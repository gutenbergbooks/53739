<h1><span class="smaller">THE DUTY OF</span><br />
AMERICAN WOMEN<br />
<span class="smaller">TO THEIR COUNTRY.</span></h1>

<p>My countrywomen, you often hear it said
that <em>intelligence and virtue</em> are indispensable
to the safety of a democratic government like
ours, where <em>the people</em> hold all the power.
You hear it said, too, that our country is in
great peril from the want of this intelligence
and virtue. But these words make a faint
impression, and it is the object of what follows
to convey these truths more vividly to
your minds.</p>

<p>This will be attempted, by presenting some
recent events, in a country where a government
similar to our own was undertaken, by a
people destitute of that intelligence and virtue
so indispensable; and then it will be shown
that similar dangers are impending over our
own country. The grand point to be illustrated
is, that a people without education have
not intelligence enough to know what measures
will secure safety and prosperity, nor
virtue enough to pursue even what they know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to be right, so that, when possessed of power,
they will adopt ruinous measures, be excited
by base passions, and be governed by wicked
and cruel men.</p>

<p>Look, then, at France during that awful period
called <em>the Reign of Terror</em>. First, observe
the process by which the power passed into
the hands of the people. An extravagant
king, a selfish aristocracy, an exacting priesthood,
had absorbed all the wealth, honour,
and power, until the people were ground to
the dust. All offices of trust and emolument
were in the hands of the privileged few, all
laws made for their benefit, all monopolies
held for their profit, while the common people
were condemned to heavy toils, with returns
not sufficient to supply the necessities of life,
so that, in some districts, famine began to stalk
through the land.</p>

<p>Speedily the press began to unfold these
wrongs, and at the same time, Lafayette and
his brave associates returned from our shores,
and spread all over the nation enthusiastic accounts
of happy America, where the people
govern themselves, unoppressed by monopoly,
or king, or noble, or priest. The press teems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
with exciting pages, and orators inflame the
public mind to a tempest of enthusiasm. The
court and the aristocratic party cower before
the storm; and ere long, the eleven hundred
representatives of the people are seen marching,
in solemn pomp, through the streets of the
capital, while the whole land rings with acclamations
of joy. They take their seats, on an
equality with nobles and king, and proceed to
form a constitution, securing the rights of the
people. It is adopted, and sworn to, by the
whole nation, with transports and songs, while
they vainly imagine that all their troubles are
at an end. But the representatives, chosen by
the people, had not the wisdom requisite for
such arduous duties as were committed to
them, nor had the people themselves the intelligence
and virtue indispensable for such a
change. Men of integrity and ability were not
selected for the new offices created. Fraud,
peculation, rapine, and profusion abounded.
Everything went wrong, and soon the country
was more distressed than ever. “What
is the cause of this?” the people demand of
their representatives. “It is the <em>aristocrats</em>,”
is the reply; “it is the king; it is the nobles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
it is the clergy. They oppose and thwart all
our measures; they will not allow our new
Constitution to work, and therefore it is that
you suffer.” And so the people are filled with
rage at those whom they suppose to be the
cause of their disappointment and sufferings.
The clergy first met the storm. “These bishops
and priests, with their vast estates, and
splendid mansions, and rich incomes&mdash;they beggar
the people, that they may riot on the spoil.”
And so the populace rage and thunder around
the national Hall of Legislation till they carry
their point, and laws are passed confiscating
the property of the clergy, and driving them
to exile or death. Their vast estates pass into
the control of the National Legislature, and for
a time, abundance and profusion reign. The
people have bread, and the office-seekers gain
immense spoils. But no wisdom or honesty is
found to administer these millions for the good
of the people. In a short time, all is gone;
distress again lashes the people to madness,
and again they demand why they do not gain
the promised plenty and prosperity. “<em>It is
the aristocrats</em>,” is the reply; “it is the king;
it is the nobles; it is the rich men. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
oppose all our measures, therefore nothing
succeeds, and the people are distressed.”</p>

<p>Next, the nobles meet the storm. “They
are traitors; they are enemies of the people;
they are plotting against our liberties; they are
living in palaces, and rolling in splendid carriages
from the hard earnings of the poor.”
The populace rage against them all over the
land. They besiege the House of Representatives;
they beseech&mdash;they threaten. At last
they carry their point; the estates of the nobles
are seized; they are declared traitors, and
doomed to banishment or death. Again millions
are placed at the control of the people’s
agents. It is calculated that by this and former
confiscations, more than <em>a thousand millions</em>
of dollars were seized for the use of the
people. Again fraud, peculation, profusion,
and mismanagement abound, till all this incomprehensible
treasure vanishes away.</p>

<p>Meantime, all the laws have been altered;
all the property has passed from its wonted
owners to new hands; the wealthy, educated,
and noble are down; the poor, the ignorant,
the base hold the offices, wealth, and power.
Everything is mismanaged. Everything goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
wrong. The people grow distracted with
their sufferings, and again demand the cause.
“It is the king; it is his extravagant Austrian
queen, who rules him and his court. They
thwart all our measures. They are sending
to brother kings for soldiers to crush our liberties.
They are gathering armies on our
borders to overwhelm us.”</p>

<p>Next, the helpless king and his family become
the mark for popular rage. Every indignity
and insult was inflicted and borne with
a patient fortitude that extorted admiration, till
finally the king is first led forth to a bloody
death; next the queen is sacrificed; next the
virtuous sister of the king; and, last, the little
dauphin is barbarously murdered.</p>

<p>Still misery rules through the nation. The
friends of the king and former government,
and all the peaceable citizens and supporters
of order, are called <em>aristocrats</em>, and every art
devised to render them objects of fear, suspicion,
and hatred, especially such of them as
hold property to tempt the cupidity of the people.
Through the whole land two parties exist;
one the distressed, bewildered, exasperated
people, raging for their rights, and driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to madness by the fancied opposition of aristocrats;
the other a trembling, cowering minority,
suffering insult, and fear, and robbery,
and often a cruel death.</p>

<p>And now priests and nobles and king and
queen are all gone, and yet the people are
more distressed than ever before. Amid these
scenes of violence, confusion, and misrule, confidence
has ceased, commerce has furled the
sail, trade has closed the door, manufactures
ceased their din, and agriculture forsaken the
plough.</p>

<p>There is no money, no credit, no confidence,
no employment, no bread. Famine, and pestilence,
and grief, and rage, and despair brood
over the land. Again the people cry to their
representatives, “Why do you not give us the
promised prosperity and plenty? We have
nothing to eat, nothing to wear; our business
and trades are at an end. The nations around
us are gathering to devour us, and what is the
cause of all these woes?”</p>

<p>“It is the Girondists,” is the reply; “it is
this party among the people’s representatives.
They are traitors; they have been bribed; they
have joined with foreign aristocrats and kings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
They interrupt all our measures, and they are
the cause of all your sufferings.”</p>

<p>And now the people turn their rage upon
the most intelligent and well-meaning portion
of their representatives, who have been striving
to stem the worst excesses of those who
yield entirely to the dictation of the mob.
After a period of storms and threats and violence,
at length a majority is gained against
them, and a decree is passed condemning a
large portion of the National Legislature as traitors,
while their leaders are borne forth by the
exulting mob to a bloody death. Still the distress
of the people is unrelieved, and again
they clamour for the cause. “It is the party
opposed to us,” say the Jacobins, with Robespierre
at their head; “they are the traitors;
they will not adopt the measures which will
save the people from these ills.”</p>

<p>“Cut them down!” cries the populace; and
again another portion of the people’s representatives
are led forth to death.</p>

<p>And now Robespierre, the leader of the lowest
mob of all, is supreme dictator, and all
power is lodged with this coldest-blooded ruffian
that ever doomed his fellow-beings to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
violent death. This was <em>the Reign of Terror</em>,
when the mob had gained complete mastery,
and this man, its advocate and organ, administered
its awful energies. Look, then, for a moment,
at the picture.</p>

<p>But the horrors of this period are so incredible,
the atrocities so monstrous, that the tale
will be regarded with distrust, without some
previous indication of the causes which led to
such results.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered, then, that this whole
revolutionary movement was, in fact, a war
of the common people upon the classes above
them. Let it be remembered, too, that the
French people, by the press, and by emissaries
all over Europe, had invoked the lower classes
of all nations to make common cause with
them. “War to the palace, and peace to the
cottage,” was their watchword. Every throne
began to shake, and every person of rank, talents,
and wealth felt his own safety involved
in the contest. It was thus that the revolutionary
leaders felt that they were contending
for their lives, against the whole wealth, aristocracy,
and monarchical power of Europe.</p>

<p>In France itself, individual ambition, hate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
envy, or vengeance added fearful power to this
war of contending classes. Not only every
leader, but every individual, found in the opposing
party some rival to displace, or some
private grudge to revenge, while ten thousand
aspirants for office demanded sacrifices, in order
to secure vacated places. At last the
struggle became so imbittered and desperate,
that each man looked out only for himself.
Friend gave up friend to save his own life, or
to secure political advancement, till confidence
between man and man perished, and society
became a mass of warring elements, excited
by every dreadful passion.</p>

<p>Few men are deliberately cruel from the
mere love of cruelty. Thousands, under the
influence of fear, revenge, ambition, or hate,
become selfish, reckless, and cruel. When,
too, in conflicts where men feel that by the
hands of opponents they have lost property,
home, honour, and country; when they have
seen their dearest friends slaughtered or starved,
then, when the hour of retaliation arrives,
pity and sympathy are dead, and every baleful
passion rages. Thus almost every man in
the conflict had suffered: if a democrat, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
those above him; if an aristocrat, from those
below him.</p>

<p>Meantime, religion, that powerful principle
in humanizing and restraining bad passions,
had well-nigh taken her flight. The war upon
the clergy at length turned to a war upon the
religion they represented, till atheism became
the prevailing principle of the nation.</p>

<p>By a public act, the leaders of the people
declared their determination “to dethrone the
King of Heaven, as well as the monarchs of
the earth.” For this end, the apostate clergy,
put in the places of those exiled, were induced
to come before the bar of the National Legislature
and publicly abjure Christianity, and
declare that “no other national religion was
now required but liberty, equality, and morality.”</p>

<p>On this occasion, crowds of drunken artisans
appeared before the bar of the house,
trampling under foot the cross, the sacramental
vases, and other emblems of religious faith.
A vile woman, dressed as the Goddess of Reason,
was publicly embraced by the presiding
officer of the National Legislature, and conducted
by him to a magnificent car, and followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
by immense crowds to the grand Cathedral
of Nôtre Dame, where she was seated
on an altar, and there received the worship of
the multitudes. The Sabbath, by a national
decree, was abolished; the Bible was burned
publicly by the executioner; and on the graveyards
was inscribed, “Death is an eternal
sleep!”</p>

<p>At Lyons, a similar scene was enacted,
where a fête in honour of Liberty was celebrated.
The churches were all closed, the
Decade, or Sabbath of Reason, proclaimed,
and an image of a vile character was carried
in procession, followed by vast crowds, shouting,
“Down with the aristocrats! Long life to
the guillotine!” After the image came an ass,
bearing the Cross, the Bible, and the communion
service; and these were led to an altar,
where a fire was lighted, the Cross and Bible
burned, the communion bread trampled under
foot, and the ass made to drink out of the communion
cup. Wherever democracy reigned,
the services of religion were interrupted, the
burial service vanished, baptisms ceased, the
sick and dying were unconsoled by religion,
while every species of vice, obscenity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
licentiousness were practised without concealment
or control. The establishments for charity,
the hospitals, and all humane institutions
were swept away, and their funds seized by
the agents of the people. Even the sepulchres
of the dead were upturned. The noble,
the wise, and the ancient, the barons of feudal
ages, the heroes of the Crusades, the military
chieftains, the ancient kings, resting in long-hallowed
tombs, the mightiest monarchs of the
nation, the “chief ones of the earth,” were
moved from their rest, and rose to meet the
coming of this awful day, while the treasures
of their tombs were rifled by vulgar hands,
and their very sculls kicked around as footballs
for sport.</p>

<p>Meantime the sovereigns of Europe were
making preparations to meet this flood of
democratic lava, which threatened to overflow
every surrounding land. Vast armies began
to gather on every side, and avenging navies
hovered along the shores. This added the
fervour of patriotic devotion to the mania of
democracy.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>These inspiring sentiments, sung in the
thrilling notes of the Marseilles Hymn, were
echoed from one end of the land to the other,
awakening a whirlwind of enthusiasm. The
wants of thousands thrown out of employ, joined
with the excitement of patriotism, raised an
army unparalleled in numbers. It is calculated
that, at one time, one million two hundred thousand
Frenchmen were thus enrolled, and at the
command of the National Legislature, while the
millions of property, not otherwise squandered,
were employed to clothe, feed, and equip
this incomprehensible multitude. All France
was bristling like an armed field; while every
mandate of government, backed as it was by
such a military force, was utterly resistless.
Thus it was that the <em>Reign of Terror</em> was so
silent, awful, and hopeless.</p>

<p>Behold, then, through the terror-stricken and
miserable land, the national troops employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in arresting every person suspected of favouring
aristocracy, or conspicuous as the holder
of wealth, or object of hate, envy, or suspicion
to all in the possession of power. Behold
the prisons of the capital, of the provincial
cities, and of the country villages, crammed
to overflowing with the rich, the noble,
and the learned. No regard was paid to station,
age, or sex. Gray hairs and blooming
childhood, stern warriors and beautiful maidens,
coarse labourers and noble matrons, were huddled
together into the damps, and filth, and
darkness of a common dungeon, while the
<em>guillotine</em> daily toiled in its bloody work of
death.</p>

<p>Whenever a fresh supply of funds was demanded
for the national service, a new alarm
of <em>invasion</em> or of <em>counter-revolution</em> was spread,
and then followed new arrests of those suspected,
or of those who held any species of wealth.
In disposing of captives to make room for new
supplies, some were poniarded in prison, some
shot, and some guillotined. At last, it was
found needful to adopt a more summary
method, and the National Legislature decreed
that the land must be cleared of traitors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
aristocrats, not by trial and single execution,
but by a slaughter of masses. A corps was
formed of the most determined and bloodthirsty,
and sent all over the land to execute
this mandate. In carrying out this unparalleled
system of cold-blooded murder, various modes
were adopted. One was called the <em>Republican
Baptism</em>, by which men, women, and children
were placed in a vessel with a trap-door in the
bottom, and carried out into the midst of the
waves; then the trap-door was opened, and
the crew, getting into a boat, left their victims
to perish. Another method was called the
<em>Republican Marriage</em>. By this, two of the
opposite sex, generally an old person and a
young one, were bereft of all clothing, then
tied together, and, after being tortured a while,
thrown into the waves. Another mode was
called the <em>mitrillade</em> or <em>fusillade</em>. Sixty, or
more, captives were bound, and ranged in two
files along a deep ditch dug for the purpose.
At the two extremities of each file, were placed
cannons loaded with grapeshot, and, at a given
signal, these were discharged on this mass of
human beings. But a few were entirely killed
at the first discharge. Wounded and mutilated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
they fell in heaps, or crawled forth, and,
with piercing shrieks, entreated the soldiers to
end their sufferings with death. Three successive
discharges did not accomplish the
work, which was finally ended by the swords
of the soldiery. Next day, the same scene was
renewed on a larger scale, more than two
hundred prisoners being thus destroyed. This
was repeated day after day; while, on one occasion,
the commanding officer rose from a
carouse, and with thirty Jacobins and twenty
courtesans, went out to enjoy a view of the
horrid scene.</p>

<p>At Toulon the mitrillades were repeated, till
at least eight hundred were thus slaughtered
in a population of less than ten thousand. In
Lyons, during only five months, six thousand
persons suffered death, and among these were
a great portion of the noblest and most virtuous
citizens. At Toulon, one of the victims
was an old man of eighty-four, and his only
crime was the possession of eighty thousand
pounds, of which he offered all but a mere
trifle to escape so shocking a death, but in
vain. Bonaparte, who saw these horrors, says,
“When I beheld this poor old man executed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
I felt as if the end of the world was at
hand.”</p>

<p>At Nantz, five hundred children, of both
sexes, the oldest not fourteen, were led out to
be shot. Never before was beheld so piteous
a sight! The stature of the little ones was so
low that the balls passed over their heads, and,
shrieking with terror, they burst their bonds,
and, rushing to their murderers, they implored
for pity and life. But in vain; the sabre finished
the dreadful work, and these babes were
slaughtered at their feet.</p>

<p>At another time, a large body of women,
most of them with young children, were carried
out into the Loire, and while the unconscious
little ones were smiling and caressing
their distressed mothers, these mothers were
bereft of all clothing, and thrown with their
infants into the waves.</p>

<p>At another time, three hundred young girls
were drowned in one night at Nantz, where,
for some months, every night, hundreds of
persons were carried forth and thrown into
the river, while their shrieks awoke the inhabitants,
and froze every heart with terror.
In this city, in a single month, either by hunger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the diseases of prison, or violence, fifteen
thousand persons perished, and more than
double that number during the Reign of Terror.</p>

<p>In the prisons not less dreadful sufferings
were endured. In these foul and gloomy
abodes, the cells were dark, humid, and filthy;
the straw, their only beds, became so putrid
that the stench was horrible, while enormous
rats and every species of vermin preyed on
the wretched inmates. In such dens as these
were gathered the rank, the beauty, the talents,
and the wealth of Paris, and the chief
cities of the land. Here, too, degraded turn-keys,
attended by fierce dogs, domineered over
their victims, while on one side were threats,
oaths, obscenity, and insult, and on the other
were vain arguments, useless supplications,
and bitter tears.</p>

<p>Every night the wheels of the rolling car
were heard, coming to carry another band of
victims to their doom. Then the bars of the
windows and wickets of the doors were
crowded by anxious listeners, to learn whether
their own names were called, or to see their
friends led out to death. Those summoned
bade a hasty farewell to their friends. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
husband left the arms of his frantic wife, the
father was torn from his weeping children, the
brother and sister, the neighbour and friend,
parted and went forth to die, while survivers,
picturing the last agonies of those they loved,
or waiting their own fate, suffered a living
death, till again the roll of the approaching
car renewed the universal agony.</p>

<p>To such a degree did this protracted torture
prey upon the mind, that many became reckless
of life, and many longed for death as a relief.</p>

<p>In many cases, women died of terror when
their cell door was opened, supposing their
hour of doom was come.</p>

<p>The prison floors were often covered with
infants, distressed by hunger, or in the agonies
of death. One evening, three hundred infants
were in one prison; the next morning all were
drowned! When the citizens once remonstrated
at this useless cruelty, the reply was, “They
are all young aristocratic vipers&mdash;let them be
stifled!”</p>

<p>Such accumulated horrors annihilated the
sympathies and charities of life. Calamity
rendered every man suspicious. Those passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in the streets feared to address their nearest
friends. As wealth was a mark for ruin,
all put on coarse, or squalid raiment. Abroad,
no symptom of animation was seen, except
when prisoners were led forth to slaughter,
and then the humane fled, and the hard-hearted
rushed forward to look upon the agonies
of death. In the family circle, all was fear
and distrust. The sound of a footstep, a voice
in the street, a knock at the door, sent paleness
to the cheek. Night brought little repose, and
in the morning all eyed each other distrustfully,
as if traitors were lurking there.</p>

<p>But there is a limit to the power of mental
suffering; and one of the saddest features of
this awful period was the torpid apathy, which
settled on the public mind, so that, eventually,
the theatres, which had been forsaken, began
to be thronged, and the multitude relieved
themselves by farces and jokes, unconcerned
whether it was twenty, or a hundred of their
fellow-citizens, who were led forth to die.</p>

<p>Learning and talent were as fatal to their
possessors as rank and wealth. The son of
Buffon the naturalist, the daughter of the eloquent
Vernay, Roucher the poet, and even the
illustrious Lavoisier, in the midst of his philosophical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
experiments, were cut down. A few
more weeks of slaughter would have swept
off all the literary talent of France.</p>

<p>During the revolutionary period, it is calculated
that not less than two hundred thousand
persons suffered imprisonment, besides
those who were put to death, of whom the
following list is furnished by the Republicans
themselves:</p>

<p>Twelve hundred and seventy-eight nobles,
seven hundred and fifty women of rank, fourteen
hundred of the clergy, and thirteen thousand
persons not noble, perished by the guillotine
under decrees of the tribunals of the
people.</p>

<p>To this, add the victims at Nantz, which are
arranged in this mournful catalogue:</p>

<table summary="How many people died at Nantz">

    <td>Children shot</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>The whole number destroyed at Nantz, of
which the above is a portion only, was thirty-two
thousand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>To these add those slaughtered in the wars
of La Vendée, viz., <em>nine hundred thousand</em>
men, <em>fifteen thousand</em> women, and <em>twenty-two
thousand</em> children. To this add the victims
at Lyons, numbering thirty-one thousand. To
this, add those who are recorded thus: “women
who died of grief, or premature childbirth,
three thousand seven hundred;” and we have
a sum-total of <em>one million twenty-two thousand</em>
human beings destroyed by violence. How
many should be added, as those who died of
prison sufferings, or from the pangs and privations
of exile, or from famine and from pestilence
consequent on this state of anarchy and
violence, who can enumerate?</p>

<p>At some periods, such was the awful slaughter,
that the rivers were discoloured with blood.
In Paris, a vast aqueduct was dug to carry off
the gore to the Seine, and four men employed
in conducting it to this reservoir. In the river
Loire, the corpses accumulated so that birds
of prey hovered all along its banks, the waters
became infected, and the fishes so poisonous
that the magistrates of Nantz forbade the
fishermen to take them.</p>

<p>Thus, in the language of another, “France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
became a kind of suburb of the world of perdition.
Surrounding nations were lost in
amazement as they beheld the scene. It seemed
a prelude to the funeral of this great world,
a stall of death, a den into which thousands
daily entered and none were seen to return.
Between ninety and a hundred of the leaders
in this mighty work of death, fell by the hand
of violence. Enemies to all men, they were
of course enemies to each other. Butchers of
the human race, they soon whetted the knife for
each other’s throats; and the same Almighty
Being who rules the universe, whose existence
they had denied by a solemn act of legislation,
whose perfections they had made the butt of
public scorn, whose Son they had crucified
afresh, and whose Word they had burned by
the hands of a common hangman, swept them
all, by the hand of violence, into an untimely
grave. The tale made every ear that heard
it tingle, and every heart chill with horror.
It was, in the language of Ossian, ‘the song of
death.’ It was like the reign of the plague in
a populous city. Knell tolled upon knell,
hearse followed hearse, coffin rumbled after
coffin, without a mourner to shed a tear, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
solitary attendant to mark the place of the
grave. ‘From one new moon to another, and
from one Sabbath to another, the world went
forth and looked upon the carcasses of the
men who transgressed against God, and they
were an abhorring unto all flesh.’”</p>

<p>Such, my countrywomen, are the scenes
which have been enacted in this very age, in
a land calling itself Christian, and boasting itself
as at the head of civilization and refinement.
Do you say that such cruelty and
bloodthirsty rage can never appear among us;
that our countrymen can never be so deluded
by falsehood and blinded by passion?</p>

<p>Look, then, at scenes which have already
occurred in our land. Look at Baltimore: it
is night, and within one of its prisons are shut
up some of its most excellent and respected
citizens. They dared to use the rights of free-men,
and express their opinions, and oppose
the measures of the majority; and for this,
a fierce multitude is raging around those walls,
demanding their blood. They force the doors,
and, with murderous weapons, reach the room
containing their victims. Some friendly hand
extinguishes the lights, and in the protecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
darkness they seek to escape. Some succeed;
others are recognised, and seized, and
stabbed, and trampled on, and dragged around
in murderous fury. One of the noblest of
these victims, apparently dead, is seized by
some pitying neighbour, under the pretence of
cruelty, and thrown into the river and carried
over a fall. There he is drawn forth and restored
to consciousness; and there, too, it is
discovered, that by Americans, by the hands of
his fellow-citizens, <em>his body has been stuck with
scores of pins, deep plunged into his flesh</em>!</p>

<p>Look, again, at the Southwest, and see gamblers
swinging uncondemned from a gallows,
and among them a harmless man, whom the
fury of the mob hung up without time for judge
or jury to detect his innocence.</p>

<p>See, on the banks of the Mississippi, fires
blazing, and American citizens <em>roasted alive</em>
by their fellow-citizens! See, even in New-England,
the boasted land of law and steady
habits, a raging mob besets a house filled with
women and young children. They set fire to
it, and the helpless inmates are driven forth
by the flames to the sole protection of darkness
and the pitiless ruffians. See, in Cincinnati,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the poor blacks driven from their homes,
insulted, beaten, pillaged, seeking refuge in
prisons and private houses, and for days kept
in constant terror and peril.</p>

<p>See, in Philadelphia, one class of citizens arrayed
in arms against another, both excited to
the highest pitch of rage, both thirsting for
each other’s blood, while the civil authority
can prevent universal pillage, misrule, and
murder, only by volleys that shoot down neighbours,
brothers, and friends.</p>

<p>See, too, how the rage of political strife has
threatened the whole nation with a civil war.
South Carolina declares that she will not submit
to certain laws, which she claims are
unconstitutional. Her own citizens are divided
into fierce parties, so exasperated that
each is preparing to shoot down the other.
Even the women are contributing their ornaments
to meet the expenses of the murderous
strife. From neighbouring states, the troops
are advancing, the ships of war are nearing
their harbours. One single act of resistance,
and the state had been the battle-field of that
most bitter, most cruel, most awful of all conflicts,
<em>a civil and a servile war</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>And all these materials of combustion are
now slumbering in our bosom, pent up a while,
but ready to burst forth, like imprisoned lava,
and deluge the land. How easy it would be
to bring the nation into fierce contest on the
subject of slavery, that internal cancer which
inflames the whole body politic! How easy
to array native citizens against foreign immigrants,
who at once oppose the prejudices
and diminish the wages of those around them!
How easy to make one section believe that
tariff, or tax, is sacrificing the prosperity of one
portion to gratify the envy, or increase the
luxuries of another!</p>

<p>How easy to make one class of humbler
means, believe that bank, or monopoly, is destroying
the fruit of their toil, to increase the
overgrown wealth of a class above them!</p>

<p>And here is no standing army, such as is
wielded by all other governments in sustaining
law. When our communities are divided
by interest or passion, the lawmakers, the judges,
the jury, and the military are all partisans
in the strife.</p>

<p>Nor can one part of the Union suffer, and
the other escape unharmed, as might be supposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
amid this reckless talk about the dissolution
of the Union. An overt attempt to dissolve
the Union is treason; and it can never be
carried out without fierce parties in every state,
ready to fight to the last gasp against such a
suicidal act. Such a national dislocation would
send a groan of agony through every city,
town, and hamlet in our land; civil war would
blow her trump, citizen would be arrayed
against citizen, and state against state, and the
whole arch of heaven would be inscribed with
“mourning, and lamentation, and wo.”</p>

<p>What, then, has saved our country from
those wide-sweeping horrors that desolated
France? Why is it that, in the excitements
of embargoes, and banks, and slavery, and abolition,
and foreign immigration, the besom of
destruction has not swept over the land? It is
because there has been such a large body of <em>educated</em>
citizens, who have had intelligence enough
to understand how to administer the affairs of
state, and a proper sense of the necessity of
sustaining law and order; who have had moral
principle enough to subdue their own passions,
and to use their influence to control the
excited minds of others. Change our large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
body of moral, intelligent, and religious people
to the ignorant, impulsive, excitable population
of France, and in one month the horrors
of the Reign of Terror would be before our
eyes. Nothing can preserve this nation from
such scenes but perpetuating this preponderance
of intelligence and virtue. This is our
only safeguard.</p>

<p>What, then, are our prospects in this respect?
Look at the monitions recorded in our
census. Let it be first conceded, that the fact
that a man cannot read and write is not, in itself,
proof that he is not intelligent and virtuous.
Many, in our country, by intercourse with men
and things, by the discussions of religion and
politics, and by the care of their affairs, gain
much reflection and mental discipline. Still,
a person who cannot read a word in a newspaper,
nor a line in his Bible, and who has so
little value for knowledge as to remain thus incapacitated,
as a general fact, is in the lowest
grade of stupidity and mental darkness. So
that the number who cannot read and write is,
perhaps, the surest exponent of the intellectual
and moral state of a community. For though
this list may embrace many intelligent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
virtuous persons, on the other hand, there are
probably as many, or more, of those classed
as being able to read and write, who never
have used this power, and who are among the
most stupid and degraded of our race.</p>

<p>Look, then, at the indications in our census.
In a population of fourteen millions, we find
<em>one million</em> adults who cannot read and write,
and <em>two millions</em> of children without schools.
In a few years, then, if these children come on
to the stage with their present neglect, we shall
have <em>three millions</em> of adults managing our
state and national affairs, who cannot even
read the Constitution they swear to support,
nor a word in the Bible, or in any newspaper
or book. Look at the West, where our dangers
from foreign immigration are the greatest,
and which, by its unparalleled increase, is
soon to hold the sceptre of power. In Ohio,
more than one third of the children attend no
school. In Indiana and Illinois scarcely one
half of the children have any schools. Missouri
and Iowa send a similar, or worse report.
In Virginia, <em>one quarter</em> of the white adults
cannot even write their names to their applications
for marriage license. In North Carolina,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<em>more than half</em> the adults cannot read and
write. The whole South, in addition to her
hordes of ignorant slaves, returns <em>more than
half</em> her white children as without schools.</p>

<p>My countrywomen, what is before us?
What awful forebodings arise! Intelligence
and virtue our only safeguards, and yet all
this mass of ignorance among us, and hundreds
of thousands of ignorant foreigners being
yearly added to augment our danger!</p>

<p>We are not even stationary. We are losing
ground every day. Every hour the clouds
are gathering blacker around us. Already it
is found, that the number of <em>voters</em> who cannot
read and write, and who yet decide every
question of safety and interest, exceeds the
great majority that brought in Harrison. Already
the number of criminals and felons, who,
on dismission from jails and penitentiaries, are
allowed to vote, exceeds the majority that
brought in our chief magistrate in 1836!<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>Nor is the picture of our situation less mournful,
when we examine into the condition of
young children in those states, which have
done the most for education. Take New-York,
for example, where, for forty years, the
education of the people has been provided for
by law, and where the very best school system
in the world has recently gone into operation.
It is the chief business of the Secretary of
State, to take care of the common schools of
the state, while, in every county, a deputy-superintendent,
paid five hundred dollars each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
year for his services, devotes his whole time
to the care of common schools. Every year
these county superintendents report to the Secretary
of State, in regard to the situation of
the schools in the county under their care. It
is from these reports of the superintendents of
schools in New-York, that we are enabled to
draw a picture of the condition of young children
in common schools, that should send a
chill of fear and alarm through our country.
For if this is the condition of young children in
that state which has excelled all others in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
wise and liberal provision for the care of
schools, what must be the condition of things
in other states, where still less interest is felt
in this great concern!</p>

<p>The Secretary of State, in presenting the
reports of the county superintendents to the
Legislature of New-York, remarks thus: “The
nakedness and deformity of the <em>great majority</em>
of schools in this state, the comfortless and dilapidated
buildings, the unhung doors, broken
sashes, absent panes, stilted benches, gaping
walls, yawning roofs, and muddy and mouldering
floors, are faithfully portrayed; and many
of the self-styled teachers, who lash and dogmatize
in these miserable tenements of humanity,
are shown to be low, vulgar, obscene,
intemperate, and utterly incompetent to teach
anything good. Thousands of the young are
repelled from improvement, and contract a durable
horror for books, by ignorant, injudicious,
and cruel modes of instruction. When the
piteous moans and tears of the little pupils supplicate
for exemption from the cold drudgery,
or more pungent suffering of the school, let the
humane parent be careful to ascertain the true
cause of grief and lamentation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>To exhibit, more fully, the sufferings of little
children at school, the following is abridged
from these reports:</p>

<h3><i>Sufferings of Little Children from Bad Schoolhouses.</i></h3>

<p>One of the county superintendents reports
of the schoolhouses in his district: “One house
in K. is literally unfit for a stable; the sashes
of several windows are broken, twenty or thirty
panes of glass are out, the door is off, and
used for a writing-table. Yet the district is
wealthy, but ‘they cannot get a vote to build
a new schoolhouse.’” “Another schoolhouse
in W. is nearly as bad; the gable ends falling
out, the chimney down, and the windows nearly
all boarded up.” Many of the schoolhouses
are situated in the highway, so that, at
play, the children are endangered by the passing
horses and vehicles, and the traveller is
also endangered by the rushing of boisterous
boys, frightening his horses. Instances of this
sort have repeatedly occurred.</p>

<p>Another writes, that in one of the largest
landed districts, the worst log schoolhouse in
the district is still retained, offering no security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
against winds and storms. One of the window
sashes was “laid up overhead because it
would not stay in its place.” To keep the
door shut against the wind, one end of a bench
was put against it, and a boy set to tend it,
as one and another went out.</p>

<p>Another writes, that he <em>often</em> finds the schoolhouses
situated on some bleak knoll, exposed
to the howling blasts of winter and the scorching
rays of the summer’s sun, or in some marsh
or swamp, surrounded by stagnant pools, rife
with miasma, and charged with disease and
death. It is not uncommon, in such places, to
find large schools almost entirely broken up
by sickness, and that, too, when no contagious
diseases are prevailing among children.</p>

<p>One of these superintendents says, “A trustee
of one school, where the schoolhouse was
situated <em>in a goose-pond</em>, the water under the
floor being several inches deep, told me his
children were almost invariably obliged to
leave school on account of sickness, and that
the school was often broken up from this cause.
Parents pay ten times as much, for physicians
to cure diseases contracted at school,
as it would cost to build a comfortable schoolhouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and supply it with every accommodation.”</p>

<p>Another says of the schoolhouses in his
county, that, in some cases, the latches are
broken, so that, however cold the day, the door
cannot be shut; sometimes the sills are so rotten
that snakes and squirrels can enter; while
there are cracks in the floor, one or two inches
wide, and holes broken large enough for the
children to fall through.</p>

<p>The wretched condition of these houses is
not owing to poverty, but to the <em>leaden apathy</em>
on the subject of education, and the belief
among farmers that their money can be better
applied in building barns and stables for
their cattle. In one large village, where a
great sum has been expended for adorning
public grounds, and where is much wealth and
style, the two schoolhouses are the meanest-looking
buildings in the place.</p>

<p>Another says of the schoolhouses in his county,
that, in many cases, they stand on the highway,
no cooling shade to protect them from the
burning sun, exposed to the full fury of the
wintry northwester, clapboards torn off, door
just ready to fall, and great caution needed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
order to keep from falling through the floor.
In one case, an aperture in the roof was of
such a size, that the teacher could give quite a
lesson on astronomy by looking up at the
heavens through the roof of the house. Frequently,
to the grief of the teacher, when the
parent brings his child the first day, such expressions
as these are heard from the clinging
and distressed child, “Oh, pa, I don’t want
to stay in this ugly, old house! Oh, pa, do
take me home!”</p>

<h3><i>Sufferings of Little Children from Want of
Accommodations at School.</i></h3>

<p>One superintendent says, “But few of the
schoolhouses are furnished with blinds or curtains
to exclude the glare of the sun. Thus,
children suffer great uneasiness, headaches,
and often serious affections of the eyes. I
have found <em>many cases</em> of weakness of eyes,
approaching almost to blindness, caused by
studying in such dazzling light.”</p>

<p>Another states, that in most schoolhouses
the desks are so high, as to compel the scholar
to write in a half-standing, half-sitting attitude;
while the seats for the smallest children are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
often twice the proper height, sometimes a
hemlock slab with legs at one end, and a log
at the other. Many of the little ones have
to be helped up on them, where they are in
peril of life and limb from a fall. Here they
are obliged to sit, day after day and week
after week, between heaven and earth, “and
in a frame of mind unfit for either place,” without
anything to support either their backs or
their feet. Those who would realize what
distress this occasions, let them try sitting only
one half hour on a table or sideboard, with
back and feet unsupported, and see what suffering
ensues.</p>

<p>Another writes thus: “Sitting with the legs
hanging over the edge of the seat presses
the <em>veins</em> (which lie near the surface, and carry
the blood to the heart), and thus retard its return,
while the arteries, being deeper, carry the
blood with its full force from the heart. Thus
the veins become distended, numbness and
pain follow, and sometimes permanent weakness
is the result. Where children sit a long
time without any support to their backs, the
muscles that hold up the body become weary
and weak, for no muscle can be too long contracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
without weakening it. In schools thus
badly furnished, it will be seen that the children
prefer the northern blasts out of doors to
the sufferings they endure within, and come in
unwillingly, with chilled bodies and checked
perspiration. In some cases, parents provide
comfortable chairs for their children, and then
it is seen, that such stay but a short time out
of doors, while those seated on such comfortless
benches stay as long as they can. This
shows one predisposing cause of the curvature
of the spine, and distortion of the body and
limbs. Is it any wonder that so many of our
youth have round shoulders, and a stooping
of the body through life?”</p>

<p>What would be said of a farmer who made
his boy hold a plough as high as his head, or
a joiner who made his apprentice plane a
board on a bench as high as his shoulders?
And yet they expect teachers to make their
children study, read and write with just such
improper accommodations.</p>

<h3><i>Sufferings of Little Children for Want of Pure
Air.</i></h3>

<p>To understand this subject properly, it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
be borne in mind, that the body is so constructed
as to inhale at every breath about a pint of
air. The air is composed of 79 parts nitrogen
and 21 parts oxygen. When it is drawn into
the lungs, the oxygen is absorbed by the blood,
and what we exhale is the nitrogen, mixed with
the carbonic acid, formed in the lungs by the
union of the oxygen of the air with the carbon
of the blood. Now, neither carbonic acid, or
nitrogen can support life. Take the oxygen
from the air, and then breathe it, and instant
death ensues. So, put any animal into carbonic
acid alone, and it dies instantly. Thus,
every breath of every human being uses up
the oxygen in one pint of air, and returns it
with only nitrogen and carbonic acid. Let a
schoolroom, containing 18,000 gallons of air
and twenty scholars, be made perfectly airtight,
and in twenty minutes they would all be
corpses. The horrible sufferings produced by
this process, were once witnessed in Calcutta,
where 146 men were driven into a room 18
feet square, with only one small window, and
kept there from eight at night till six next
morning. Before midnight they all became
frantic with agony, fought for the window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
choaked each other to death, screamed to the
soldiers to shoot them, and thus end their misery;
and in the morning only 26 were alive,
and these in a putrid fever! <em>Lessening</em> the
amount of oxygen in the air by breathing, produces
languor, sleepiness, nausea, headache,
flushed face, and sometimes palsy and apoplexy.</p>

<p>On this subject, the superintendents of the
New-York schools make these statements:</p>

<p>“Confinement in some of our schoolrooms
is <em>manslaughter</em>. Our children, shut up in
these hot holes, made so by their own breaths,
by perspiration, and by a close, overheated
stove, lay the foundation for diseases which
show no gain except to the physician, and
which, in after-life, no riding on horseback, or
journeys by sea or land, or southern residence
can cure.”</p>

<p>Another states, that the uncomfortable condition
of the schoolhouses, in his county, is such
as to cause much suffering, both mental and
bodily, to the children doomed to inhabit their
gloomy walls and breathe the tainted air.</p>

<p>Another writes of the schoolhouses in his
district, that they are usually low, and in cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
weather so overheated as to be hotbeds of disease,
the close atmosphere being actually dangerous.
One teacher, in one instance, was struck
with palsy from the effects of confinement in
such a poisonous atmosphere. At a public meeting,
one citizen stated it as his conviction, that
one of his children died from disease engendered
by breathing the pestilential atmosphere
of the schoolroom. Instances are numerous
where the children come home dull, listless,
and with severe colds and coughs. The teacher,
in such situations, often loses ambition, energy,
and health, and closes school pale and
emaciated, perhaps to sink to an early grave,
a victim of the poisonous air in which, for day
after day, he has been confined.</p>

<h3><i>Sufferings of Little Children from Cold, Heat,
and Filth.</i></h3>

<p>One superintendent says, “Could parents
witness, as I have, the sufferings of their children
from cold, I am sure no other appeal
would be needed. Some of those buildings, I
am confident, would be considered by a systematic
farmer, who regarded the comfort of his
stock, as an unfit shelter for his Berkshires.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Another states, that in some cases the
schoolhouses are small and overheated. Then
the teacher throws open the door, and a current
of cold air pours on to the children. The
reeking perspiration is suddenly stopped, and
“a cold” is the result, which is often the precursor
of fevers and consumption. When no
such results follow, the parents say, “It is <em>only
a cold</em>;” when diseases and death follow, it is
called <em>a dispensation of Providence</em>! A physician
of extensive practice stated to this superintendent,
that a large part of his consumptive
cases originated from colds taken at
school.</p>

<p>Another describes one of the schoolhouses
in his county as too small, too low, the seats
too high, half the plastering fallen off and piled
in one corner, and the house warmed by a
cook-stove unfit for use. Six sevenths of the
panes of glass were gone, and two windows
boarded up. Going to attend the annual
school meeting at this house, he met two citizens
coming with a candle and firebrands, and
picking up sticks along the road for a fire,
because there was no wood provided at the
schoolhouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Another thus describes some of the schoolhouses
in his county. It is very common to
see cracked and broken stoves, the door without
hinges or latch, and a rusty pipe of various
sizes. Green wood, and that which is old
and partially decayed, either drenched with
rain, or covered with snow, is much more
frequently used than sound, seasoned wood.
Thus it is difficult to kindle a fire, and the
room is filled with smoke much of the time,
especially in stormy weather. Sometimes the
school is interrupted two or three times a day
to fasten up the stovepipe.</p>

<p>The extent of these evils may be perceived
from the report, which says of one county
about as well supplied as any, out of <em>eighty-seven</em>
districts only <em>twenty</em> schoolhouses have
provided means for keeping their wood dry.</p>

<p>Another says, “At the commencement of
the winter term of our schools, some one of
the trustees generally furnishes a load of green
wood, perhaps his own proportion. The teacher
proceeds till this is exhausted, and he is compelled
to notify his patrons of the entire destitution
of wood. After meeting his school, and
shivering over expiring embers till the hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of a supply is exhausted, he dismisses the
school for one, two, or three days, and sometimes
for a week, before any inhabitant finds
time to get another load of green wood. With
such wood it is impossible to keep the schoolroom
at a proper temperature. The scholars,
at first, crowd around the stove, suffering extremely
with cold, and then are driven as far
off as they can get, in a high state of perspiration,
and almost suffocated with heat. Our
schools in this country suffer much from such
methods of procuring fuel. The time which
is lost in school hours by the use of green
wood, I think will include near one fourth of the
whole time.”</p>

<p>Another says, “The teacher found abundant
employment in stuffing the old stove with
green birch and elm, cut as occasion required
by the teacher and the boys. A continual
coughing was kept up by nearly seven-eighths
of the children, and the teacher apologised for
want of order by saying, ‘they could not
usually do much in stormy weather till afternoon,
when the fire would get a going.’ On
this occasion, one trustee and two of the inhabitants
of the district were present an hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
when, getting frozen out, they asked to be excused,
and left the children to suffer, saying,
‘We did not think our house was so uncomfortable.
Some glass must be got, and a load
of dry wood’” Some of the statements of
these superintendents, as to the order and neatness
of their schoolhouses, are no less lamentable.
One remarks, that “some of them, as
to neatness, resemble the domicil for swine.”
Another describes one schoolhouse as “having
the clapboards torn off, the door just ready
to fall, an aperture in the roof where the chimney
once was, slabs with a pair of clubs at each
end for legs, and so high no child could touch
foot to the floor, rickety desks falling to ruin,
the plaster torn off, and the whole covered
with dirt, and as filthy as the street itself.”
But this is not all. “This house is situated in
a district of wealthy farmers.”</p>

<p>Another says, “It is a startling truth, that very
many of our schoolhouses furnish no private
retreat whatever for teacher or scholar. Thus
is one side of the schoolhouse, and, in some
instances, the doorstep, rendered a scene more
disgusting than the filth of a pig-sty.”</p>

<p>Another says, “Schoolhouses, generally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
are not furnished with suitable conveniences
for disposing the outer garments of the children,
their dinner-baskets, and other articles. Sometimes
there are a few nails in an outer entry
where clothes and dinners may be put, but in
such cases the door is left open for rain and
snow to beat in; the scholars, in their haste to
get their own clothes, pull down many more,
which are trampled on. Moreover, the dinners
are often frozen, or eaten by dogs, and
sometimes even by hogs.”</p>

<h3><i>Sufferings of Little Children from Cruel and
Improper Punishments.</i></h3>

<p>In reporting on this subject, the county superintendents
mention these as inflictions not
uncommon. Standing on one foot for a long
time; “sitting on nothing,” that is, obliging the
child to hold himself in a sitting posture without
any support; holding out the arm horizontally
with a weight on it; tying a finger so
high as to oblige the child to stand on tiptoe;
holding the head downward, sometimes causing
dangerous hemorrhages from the nose, or
injuring the brain; frightening little children
by threats. Many cases are declared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
have occurred in which permanent injuries
have been inflicted by thus straining the muscles,
and torturing the body and mind of little
children.</p>

<p>The following is a description of a scene
witnessed at school by one of the county superintendents
in his periodical visitation: two
girls, about twelve years of age, were out of
order, and the teacher, without any warning,
sprang across the room and severely flogged
both. A little boy, tired of sitting on his hard
seat, leaned over on his elbow; he was caught
by the head, dragged over the desk to the
floor, and ordered to study. A little girl of
seven, after one or two admonitions to “tend
her book,” was caught by the arm, dragged
on to the floor, rudely shaken, cuffed on both
sides of her head, and then whipped. “I looked
around,” says the superintendent, “to learn
the effect upon the other scholars. I saw no
happy faces. There seemed to settle upon the
countenances of nearly all, a cloud of gloom
and terror. The school closed soon after, and
the teacher remarked to me, that <em>he did not
punish near as much now as he formerly
did</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Moral Injuries inflicted on Children at School.</i></h3>

<p>One teacher writes thus: “Where the plastering
remains, it is covered with coal marks,
and numerous holes are cut through the writing
desks, while vulgarities and obscenities
are not only written, but deeply cut in the
desks and doors.” Of another house he says,
“Within and without are manifest evidences
of a polluted imagination. Several lewd representations
are deep cut in the clapboards in
front of the house, in the entry, and even on
the girls’ desks, so as to be constantly before
their eyes.” “These things,” he adds, “are
but <em>specimens</em> selected from <em>scores</em>.”</p>

<p>Another writes thus: “I have alluded to the
representations of vulgarity and obscenity that
meet the eye in every direction. I am constrained
to add that, during intermissions, ‘certain
lewd fellows of the baser sort’ sometimes
lecture boys and girls, large and small, illustrating
their subject by these vile delineations.
Many of our schoolhouses are nurseries of
disorder, vulgarity, profanity, and obscenity&mdash;nay,
more, in some cases, they are the very
hothouses of licentiousness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>One single statement, made up from these
reports of the county superintendents, and presented
by the head superintendent in his report,
speaks volumes on the neglect of modesty, decency,
neatness, and purity. In the whole
state there are six thousand schoolhouses destitute
of any kind of woodhouse or privy; and
of the whole number, only about one thousand
have privies provided with separate accommodations
for children of different sexes.</p>

<p>It appears, also, that though the schools and
teachers are fast rising in character, and that
many now are of uncommon excellence, yet
that many of the teachers are notoriously depraved,
while intellectual training, in the majority
of cases, is deplorably low, and the moral
training still more defective.</p>

<p>One superintendent remarks, “Gloomy, indeed,
are the impressions made by our schoolhouses.
The lessons of immorality and indecency
often taught there would cause a shudder
to thrill every sensitive mind.” Another
says, “There are, I regret to say, many teachers
whose morals, manners, and daily example
wholly unfit them for their duties.” Another
says, “In some instances, moral qualifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
have been wholly disregarded, and
teachers notoriously intemperate employed.”
Says another, “I have found a number whose
language was low, obscene, and sensual, still
employed in teaching.”</p>

<p>Says another, “If the tastes, associations,
and moral sentiments of the teacher lack elevation
and dignity, what literary progress will
atone for examples so pernicious? And yet
such are the moral influences shed about them
by many licensed to teach.”</p>

<p>After presenting all these shocking details,
the chief superintendent, in 1844, thus remarks:</p>

<p>“No subject connected with elementary instruction
affords a source for such mortifying
and humiliating reflection as that of the condition
of a large portion of the schoolhouses as
presented in the above enumeration. Only <em>one
third</em> of the whole number visited were found
in good repair; another third in only comfortable
condition; while <em>three thousand three hundred
and nineteen</em> were unfit for the reception
of man or beast. Seven thousand were found
destitute of any play-ground, nearly six thousand
destitute of convenient seats and desks, nearly
eight thousand destitute of any proper facilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
for ventilation, and upward of six thousand destitute
of a privy of any sort. And it is in these
miserable abodes of filth and dirt, deprived of
wholesome air, or exposed to the assaults of
the elements, with no facilities for exercise or
relaxation, with no conveniences for prosecuting
their studies, crowded together on benches
not admitting of a moment’s rest, and debarred
the possibility of yielding to the ordinary
calls of nature without violent inroads
upon modesty and shame, that upward of
two hundred thousand children of this state
are compelled to spend an average period of
eight months each year of their pupilage. Here
the first lessons of human life, the incipient
principles of morality, and the rules of social
intercourse are to be impressed on the plastic
mind. The boy is here to receive the model
of his permanent character, and imbibe the elements
of his future career. Here the instinctive
delicacy of the young female, one of the
characteristic ornaments of her sex, is to be
expanded into maturity by precept and example.
Such are the temples of science, such
the ministers under whose care susceptible
childhood is to receive its earliest impressions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Great God! shall man dare to charge to thy
dispensations the vices, the crimes, the sickness,
the sorrows, the miseries, and the brevity
of human life, who sends his little children
to a pesthouse, fraught with the deadly malaria
of both moral and physical disease? Instead
of impious murmurs, let him lay his hand
on his mouth, and his mouth in the dust, and
cry ‘Unclean!’”</p>

<p>Let it not be imagined that this picture is
peculiar to New-York. The superintendents
of the common schools in Ohio, and even in
Massachusetts and Connecticut, have reported
similar evils as existing, to a greater or less
extent, in the schools in their respective states;
and if such things exist in the states where
most has been done for education, what can
be hoped for the neglected and abused little
ones where even less is done by law for their
comfort and improvement? In view of such
utter destitution of schools in the greater part
of our country, and of the sufferings and neglect
endured by little children in other portions,
the inquiry must be earnestly pressed,
“What can be the reason of this deplorable
state of things?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The grand reason is, the <em>selfish apathy</em> of the
educated classes, and the <em>stupid apathy</em> of those
who are too ignorant to appreciate an education
for their children. In those states where
no school system is established by law, the intelligent
and wealthy content themselves with
securing a good education for their own children,
and care nothing for the rest. When any
project, therefore, is presented for obtaining
a good school system, the rich and intelligent
do not wish to be taxed for the children of
others, and the rest do not care whether their
children are educated or not, or else are too
poor to pay the expense.</p>

<p>In those states where a school system is
established, parents of intelligence and moral
worth, seeing the neglected state of the
common school, withdraw their children to
private schools. And feeling no interest in
schools which they do not patronise, they pass
them with utter neglect. And thus, neither
rich, nor poor care enough to be willing to be
taxed for their elevation and improvement.</p>

<p>Thus, too, it has come to pass, that while
every intelligent man in the Union is reading,
and hearing, and saying, every day of his life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that unless our children are trained to virtue and
intelligence, the nation is ruined, yet there is
nothing else for which so little interest is felt, or
so little done. Look, now, to that great body of
intelligent and benevolent persons, who are interesting
themselves for patriotic and religious
enterprises. We see them sustaining great organizations,
and supporting men to devote their
whole time to promote these several enterprises,
which draw thousands and hundreds of thousands
from the public for their support. There
is one organization, to send missionaries to the
heathen and to educate heathen children, with
its six or eight paid officers, devoting their
whole time to the object. Then there is another
to furnish the Bible, and another to distribute
tracts, and another to educate young
men to become ministers, and another to send
out home missionaries, and another to sustain
Western colleges, and another to promote temperance,
and another to promote the observance
of the Sabbath. Then we have an association
to take care of sailors, and another
to promote the comfort and improvement of
convicts in prisons and penitentiaries, and another
to relieve and ransom the slave, and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to colonize the free coloured race. All
these objects are promoted by having men sustained
by voluntary contributions, who spend
their whole time in urging the claims of these
various objects on the public mind, while almost
all have a regular periodical to advocate
their cause. But our two millions of little children,
who are growing up in heathenish darkness,
enchained in ignorance, and in many cases,
where the cold law professes to provide
for them, enduring distress of body and mind
even greater than is inflicted on criminals in
our prisons, where is the benevolent association
for their relief? where is there a periodical
supported by the charitable to tell the tale
of their wrongs? where is there a single man
sustained by Christian benevolence to operate
for their relief?</p>

<p>Let it not be claimed that Sunday-schools
meet this emergency. A Sunday-school cannot,
in its one or two short hours, educate a
child, or undo all the fatal influences of six
days of idle vagrancy, with their pernicious
lessons of vice and sin. Besides, the Sabbath-school
is of little avail, except where there is
a large class of intelligent and benevolent persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to labour, and such are thinly sprinkled
in those portions of the land where no schools
exist.</p>

<p>The vast proportion of neglected children
in our land are never reached, even by the
feeble influence of the Sunday-school.</p>

<p>And this fatal neglect cannot be palliated
by the plea, that the means employed to sustain
other objects cannot be directed to this
cause. Why cannot the press be employed
for <em>popular education</em> as efficiently as for the
promotion of temperance, or the support of the
Sabbath? Why cannot men of talents be
supported to write and to labour for this cause
as well as for any other? The only thing
that can save us is, to arouse this people from
the <em>fatal apathy</em> which is luring them to destruction.
Ministers must preach, agents must
lecture, conventions must be called, discussions
must be urged, tracts must be written and circulated,
the political press must be enlisted,
and every possible mode of arousing public
attention must be adopted. It must be shown
that teachers are needed as much as ministers,
that teachers’ institutions are as important as
colleges, that it is as necessary to educate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
send forth “poor and pious young women” to
teach, as it is “poor and pious young men” to
preach. And when the same influence and
efforts are directed to educate our two millions
of American children, as are now directed to
establishing missions among the heathen, our
country may escape the yawning abyss now
gaping to destroy.</p>

<p>The American people are sanguine and
hasty, careless of peril, and thoughtless of
risk, but, when brought by danger to reflection,
they have first-rate common sense, surpassing
energy, and endless resources. And
if they can but be convinced of their danger
<em>in season</em>, all is safe; but the work to be done
is prodigious, the time is short, and the question
all turns on whether the work will be
undertaken soon enough, and with sufficient
energy.</p>

<p>Look, then, at the work to be done. Two
millions of destitute children to be supplied with
schools! To meet this demand, <em>sixty thousand</em>
teachers and <em>fifty thousand</em> schoolhouses
are required. Or, if we can afford to leave
half of them to grow up in ignorance, and aim
only to educate the other half, thirty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
teachers and twenty-five thousand schoolhouses
must be provided, and that, too, <em>within
twelve years</em>. The census calculates the children
between four and sixteen, and in twelve
years most of these children will be beyond the
reach of school instruction, while other millions,
treading on their heels, will demand still
greater supplies. <em>Sixty thousand teachers</em> now
needed for present wants, and thousands, to be
added every year for the increase of population!</p>

<p>Where are we to raise such an army of
teachers? Not from the sex which finds it so
much more honourable, easy, and lucrative to
enter the many roads to wealth and honour
open in this land. But a few will turn from
these, to the humble, unhonoured toils of the
schoolroom and its penurious reward.</p>

<p>It is <em>woman</em> who is to come in at this emergency,
and meet the demand; woman, whom
experience and testimony has shown to be the
best, as well as the cheapest guardian and
teacher of childhood, in the school as well as
the nursery. Already, in those parts of our
country where education is most prosperous,
the larger part of the teachers of common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
schools are women. In Massachusetts, three
out of five of all the teachers are women. In
the State of New-York and in Philadelphia
similar results are seen.</p>

<p>Women, then, are to be educated for teachers,
and sent to the destitute children of this
nation by hundreds and by thousands. This is
the way in which <em>a profession</em> is to be created
for woman&mdash;a profession as honourable and
as lucrative for her as the legal, medical, and
theological are for men. This is the way in
which thousands of intelligent and respectable
women, who toil for a pittance scarcely sufficient
to sustain life, are to be relieved and elevated.
This is the way, and <em>the only way</em>, in
which our nation can be saved from impending
perils. Though we are now in such a
condition that many have given over our case
in despair, as too far gone for remedy&mdash;though
the peril is immense, and the work to be done
enormous, yet <em>it is in the power of American
women to save their country</em>. There is benevolence
enough, there are means enough
at their command. All that is needed is a
knowledge of the danger, and a faithful use
of the means within their reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>And who else, in such an emergency as
this, can so appropriately be invoked to aid?
It is woman who is the natural and appropriate
guardian of childhood. It is woman who
has those tender sympathies which can most
readily feel for the wants and sufferings of the
young. It is woman, who is especially interested
in all efforts which tend to elevate and
dignify her own sex. It is woman, too, who
has that conscientiousness and religious devotion,
which, in any worthy cause, are the surest
pledges of success.</p>

<p>And it is the pride and honour of our country,
that woman holds a commanding influence
in the domestic and social circle, which
is accorded to the sex in no other nation, and
such as will make her wishes and efforts, if
united for a benevolent and patriotic object,
almost omnipotent.</p>

<p>To you, then, American women, are brought
these two millions of suffering and destitute children;
these “despised little ones,” of whom is
written, “their angels do always behold the
face of our Father in heaven;” who are loved
and cared for by the good Shepherd above, so
that it were better for any of us, that we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
thrown with a millstone about our necks into
the sea, than that, through our guilty neglect,
even one of these little ones should perish.</p>

<p>To you, my countrywomen, these little children
call, with voices soft as the young ravens’
cry, yet multitudinous as the murmuring ocean
waves. To you they complain of the filth,
and the weariness, and the aching muscles,
and the throbbing head, and the tortured eyes.
To you they lament the degrading scenes and
fatal influences, that wither all that is pure, and
sweet, and lovely in childhood and youth.
Of you they ask relief from suffering, and all
those blessed ministries that will lead their
young feet to usefulness and happiness on
earth, and to glory, honour, and immortality
on high. Ah, surely their supplications will
be heard, and speedy relief will be found!</p>

<p><em>How</em>, then, can American women act for
these children, and thus for the salvation of
their country, in an emergency like this?</p>

<p>Before answering this question, it is needful
to consider that the education demanded for
the American people is not merely to be
taught to read and write. In communities
where it is the universal fashion to read, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
where books and papers are multitudinous as
the flakes of heaven, it might, perhaps, suffice
to teach a child to read, so far as intellect is
concerned. But if the tastes and principles
are not formed aright, the probability is, that
blank ignorance would be better than the poisonous
food, which a mind, thus sent forth to
seek its own supplies, would inevitably select.
But in those sections of our country that are
most deficient in schools, there are neither
books, nor the desire, or the taste for reading
them. And among those who are taught to
read, thousands go from the portals of knowledge
to daily toil, or to vicious indulgences,
leaving the mind as empty and stupid as if no
such ability were gained. And how many
there are, who have sharpened their faculties
only as edged tools for greater mischief! No;
the American people are to be educated <em>for
their high duties</em>. The children who, ere long,
are to decide whether we shall have tariff or
no tariff, bank or no bank, slavery or no slavery,
naturalization laws or no such laws,
must be trained so that they cannot be duped
and excited by demagogues, and thus led on
to the ruin that overwhelmed the people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
France. They must be trained to read, and think,
and decide <em>intelligently</em> on all matters where
they are to act as legislators, judges, jury, and
executive. The children who, ere long, are to
be thrown into the heats and passion of political
strife and sectional jealousy, must be trained
to rule their passions, and to control themselves
by reason, religion, and law. The
young daughters of this nation, too, must be
trained to become the educators of all the future
statesmen, legislators, judges, juries, and
magistrates of this land. For to them are to
be committed the minds and habits of every
future child, at the time when every impression
is indelible, and every influence efficient.
What, then, can American women do in forwarding
an enterprise so vast and so important?</p>

<p>In the first place, there is no woman in <em>any</em>
station, who has not work cut out to her hand.
Wherever there is <em>a single ignorant child</em>,
there is one of the future rulers or educators
of this nation; <em>there</em> is one immortal being,
who, if neglected, will become an engine of
mischief to our country, and at last sink to
eternal wo; or, if trained aright, will prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a blessing to our nation, and an angel of light
in heaven. And no woman is free from guilt,
or free from the terrific responsibilities of the
perils impending over her country, till she has
done <em>all in her power</em> to secure a <em>proper</em> education
to <em>all</em> the young minds within the reach
of her influence.</p>

<p>Is it asked, What then; would you require
every woman to turn teacher and keep school?
No; but every woman is bound to bring this
into the list of <em>her duties</em>, and, as one of her
most imperious duties, <em>to do all in her power
to secure a proper education to the American
children now coming upon the stage</em>.</p>

<p>Every woman has various duties pressing
upon her attention. It is right for her, it is
her duty, to cultivate her own mind by reading
and study, not merely for her own gratification
or credit, but with the great end in
view of employing her knowledge and energies
for the good of others. It is right, and a
duty for a woman to attend to domestic affairs;
but, except in cases of emergency, it is
not right to devote all her time to this alone.
It is a duty for her to attend to religious efforts
and ordinances; but it is not right for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to give all her time to these alone. It is right for
her to devote some time to social enjoyments,
some time to the elegancies and ornaments of
taste, some time to the adornment of person
and residence, and some time to the relaxation
of mere amusement. In many cases, these
last are as much duties as the more weighty
pursuits of life.</p>

<p>But this great maxim is ever to be borne in
mind, <em>The most important things first in attention</em>.
It is <em>the due proportion</em> of time and attention
that decides the rectitude of all useful
or innocent pursuits. And a woman is bound
so to divide her time, as to give <em>some</em> portion
of it to each of her several duties, so that
no one shall be entirely crowded out; and so,
also, to apportion her attention, that each shall
be regarded according to <em>its relative value</em>.</p>

<p>In this view of the subject, what, except
her own immortal interest, can an American
woman place, as demanding more serious attention
and more earnest efforts, than an attempt
to use her time and influence to avert
the dangers now impending over her country,
her kindred, and herself? Is there any ornamental
design, any gratification of taste or appetite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
any merely temporal good, that can at
all be placed in comparison with this great
concern? Is it, then, assuming too much to
claim that every American woman is bound
to give, not only <em>some</em> time, but <em>more</em> time to
this enterprise than she gives to any social enjoyment,
any personal or domestic decoration,
or any species of amusement? Is it not so?
Is it right for a conscientious woman, when
all that is dear and sacred is in such peril&mdash;when
she has means, time, or influence which
will aid in saving her country, her friends, and
herself from such dangers&mdash;is it right to give
to this effort less attention and time than is devoted
to visiting, or to entertaining company,
or to the adornment of her person or her house?
Judge ye, as ye will give account for these
things to the Judge of quick and dead.</p>

<p>What, then, are the ways in which an educated
woman can employ the talents committed
to her for the salvation of her country?</p>

<p>Many may be pointed out, some one of
which can be adopted by every woman in
this nation.</p>

<p>Some, who are mothers, can superintend
the education of their children, and, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
doing it, can seek in their own vicinity orphans,
or children of peculiar promise, and
train them with their own children to become
teachers of others.</p>

<p>Some, who are sisters, can superintend the
education of younger brothers and sisters, and
add to this class others of humbler means,
whom they may thus prepare for missionary
teachers in some of the destitute villages of
our land.</p>

<p>Some, who are just returned from school,
with all their knowledge fresh, and all their
powers in active play, may collect a class
around them in the vicinity of their homes,
and impart the discipline of mind and treasures
of knowledge given them by God, not to
be laid up as in a napkin, but to be employed
for the good of others. Thus they will be
raising up, not only useful teachers, but valuable
friends for the exigencies of future life.</p>

<p>Oh, how much happier, and more respectable,
and more lovely, in such benevolent toils,
than in the shopping, dressing, calling, gossiping
round pursued by a large portion of the
daughters of wealth!</p>

<p>Some, on completing their education, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
interest themselves in the common schools in
their vicinity, seeking the friendship of the
teacher, and then contributing their time and
labour to raise the school to higher intellectual
and moral excellence.</p>

<p>Some, who have a missionary spirit, may
go forth to the destitute portions of our land,
and collect the future sovereigns and educators
of this nation, and train them for their
duties.</p>

<p>Some, who have wealth at their command,
understanding that much is required from
them to whom much is given&mdash;that wealth is
bestowed, not for selfish enjoyment, but for the
good of others&mdash;that education is conferred,
not as the means of selfish distinction and advantage,
but as the instrument for benefiting
mankind&mdash;such may devote <em>time</em>, and <em>service</em>,
and <em>wealth</em> to this noble enterprise. Such
may aid in founding and superintending institutions
for the education and location of female
teachers, thus originating permanent fountains
of knowledge and influence, that long shall
send forth bounteous waters in all portions of
our land.</p>

<p>Some, who cannot enter personally into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
such labours, may aid in furnishing means to
send forth others into the field. There are
hundreds and thousands of benevolent women
in the land, who would rejoice to spend
and be spent in this service, but who have neither
the opportunity to qualify themselves, nor
the assistance necessary in finding the proper
location when prepared. Why is it not time
to turn some of the charity of woman, which
so long has clothed and educated young men
for their benevolent ministries, to aiding their
own sex in as important and more neglected
service?</p>

<p>Some can interest themselves in the schools
in their vicinity, and aid the teacher by sympathy,
counsel, and lending suitable books. A
woman who is well informed herself, may, in
this way, do much to save both the body and
minds of children from great evils. On such
an errand, in some cases, she will find young
children pent up in a tight room, heated by a
close stove, poisoning the air with their breaths,
without the least relief from the process of
ventilation, so easily secured by a trap-door
in the upper wall. Thus it is, that many children
engender weak stomachs, headaches, feeble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
constitutions, and sometimes deformity and
death. In other cases, she may rescue some
little sufferers from the torture of supporting
the body on high and hard benches, without
any aid to the muscles from a support to the
back. Thus it is that children sometimes are
rendered feeble and distorted, especially those
of delicate conformation. In other cases, she
may ascertain, by her own inspection, the
shameful neglect of cleanliness, comfort, modesty,
and decency, too often to be found in our
common schools. Nowhere else is the supervision
of woman so much demanded. The
preceding details of the situation of our common
schools in these respects, found in reports
made by the state officers of education in New-York,
where great efforts have been made to
remove such evils, are painful indications of
the shocking abuses which are to be remedied.
The poor in our almshouses, the criminals in
our prisons, even the cattle in our stables, have
more attention paid to their comfort than is
given to thousands and thousands of the little
children of our country. In other cases, she
can inquire into the course of study, and the
modes of giving moral and religious instruction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and into the character of the books used
in school, and if any improvement or alteration
is needed, by seeking the confidence and
friendship of the teacher, and lending her
books to read on the subject, or by influencing
trustees and those who direct the school, she
may remedy evils and secure improvement.</p>

<p>In some portions of the country where education
is most prosperous, the mothers of a
district have formed an association for the improvement
of the school which their children
attend. This is usually brought about by the
teacher of the school. These mothers meet
once a month, to consult, or to read books, or
to visit the school, and their contributions of
money are used to increase the school apparatus,
or to buy the books needed by the teacher
or themselves for this object.</p>

<p>Some can interest themselves for the <em>domestics</em>
of their family, to whom the health,
character, and happiness of little children is
so extensively intrusted. By kind expressions
of interest, by conversing with them on their
pursuits and duties, by lending useful books
adapted to their capacities, by reading to them,
by inducing them to secure suitable religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
privileges, and by using all practicable means
to impart knowledge and moral principle, much
may be done for this greatly neglected class,
who not only have so much influence over the
children of others, but are most of them, ere
long, to rear children of their own. In no way
can a mother so surely receive her reward as
in faithful and benevolent efforts for her domestics.</p>

<p>Some can employ their time and means in
circulating books, papers, and tracts, which
shall enlighten the people, and awaken them to
their duties and dangers. Some can use their
personal influence over fathers, sons, husbands,
brothers, and friends, presenting this subject to
their attention, pointing out articles for them
to read, and urging any measures that may
tend to advance this cause. Some may approach
their clergyman, and if he needs any
information, or any quickening on the subject,
furnish the books, and add entreaties to secure
his powerful influence both in private and in
the pulpit.</p>

<p>Some can employ the pen in writing to
arouse public interest, and their influence in
getting articles on this subject into newspapers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Such works as the periodicals on Education,
published in Boston and Albany,
Stowe’s and Mann’s Reports on the Systems
of Education in Europe, and the volume called
the School and Schoolmaster, will furnish
materials for such articles.</p>

<p>Some, who have but little time at command,
can render very essential service by an occasional
visit to the schools in their vicinity, especially
in seasons of examination; thus encouraging
both teachers and pupils by the conviction
that their labours are known and appreciated,
and that the community around are interested
in their success. If the influential ladies
in any place would go but once a year to
the schools in their vicinity, to inquire for their
comfort and prosperity, it would give a wonderful
impulse to the cause of education. The
torpid indifference of the influential classes to
the education of the young, except where their
own families are concerned, is the grand cause
of all the dangers that threaten us.</p>

<p>There are many who feel that any useful
object of common interest can be more successfully
achieved <em>by association</em> than by individual
influence. Such are accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
form societies, or associations, with officers
and committees. In cases where this mode
of operating is common and popular, a Ladies’
School Association might be formed, who
might act somewhat in this manner:</p>

<p>A meeting might be called, of all ladies in
the place, disposed to lend their influence to
promote the proper education of American children,
where some gentlemen, familiar with the
subject, might address them. Committees
might then be appointed to obtain information
on these questions. Are all the children in
this vicinity so provided with schools and
<em>schoolbooks</em> that they are gaining a <em>proper</em> education?
Do the Sunday-schools avail to secure
<em>a proper</em> education to the children who
go to no other? Is the Bible used, or any
moral or religious instruction given in the
schools? Where schools are provided, what
is the condition of the schoolhouse, the seats
and desks, the mode of heating and ventilating,
the order and neatness of the premises,
and what are the outdoor accommodations?</p>

<p>When the committees have obtained the information
on these points, another meeting can
be called to hear their reports, and to devise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
means for remedying any evils or deficiencies
that may have been discovered.</p>

<p>In proceeding in this way, it will be indispensable
to seek the good-will and co-operation
of the teachers whose schools are examined;
and as these measures would all tend to
promote their comfort and usefulness, a moderate
degree of discretion and kindness would
secure their ready co-operation.</p>

<p>Those who are so infirm, or so embarrassed
in other ways, that they cannot engage in any
one of the measures suggested above, can at
least <em>speak</em> to those around them, and endeavour
to influence them to engage in this work.</p>

<p>Those who have access to men of wealth
and influence, those who can approach the
minds that are forming comprehensive plans,
and enlisting thousands to promote them, may,
in many cases, most efficiently aid this cause
by urging such inquiries as these.</p>

<p>Why is it that no plans are formed to train
up our own millions of destitute children?
Why is no organization effected to educate
and locate female teachers, when there are
hundreds and thousands in our land, who have
a truly missionary spirit, and are longing to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
sent forth? Why should so much money be
collected for a nine year’s course for young
men, who are to go forth as preachers, and
<em>none</em> be received for the education and location
of young women, who, as teachers in destitute
villages, could, with only one or two
year’s education, do as much good as missionary
preachers?</p>

<p>If women are called upon to spend their
time and money in clothing and educating
young men, is it not proper and reasonable
that the other sex should do something to aid
young women who are longing to be sent forth
to save the perishing children of our country?</p>

<p>Is it not required that children should be
<em>trained up</em> in the way they should go? and
ought there not to be benevolent organizations
to secure this, as much as organizations to <em>reform
and convert</em> those who are vicious and
irreligious, simply because they are not thus
trained?</p>

<p>Is it not better to save children from being
poisoned, than to pay physicians for trying to
cure them after they are contaminated, and, in
many cases, beyond the reach of cure?</p>

<p>Is it not as important to send forth tracts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
influence the people to educate their children
virtuously and religiously, as it is to send forth
tracts to convert and reform them after they
have been trained up to vice and irreligion?</p>

<p>Is it not as important to teach our two millions
of destitute children to read, as it is to
send forth tracts, and Bibles, and colporteurs to
a population where three millions cannot read
a line in Bible or tract?</p>

<p>Is it not as important to organize, in order to
secure a good common-school education to our
millions who cannot read, as it is to sustain
and endow colleges for the few thousand youth
who enjoy their advantages, and who have
such disproportionate treasures lavished on
their education?</p>

<p>If we neglect the democracy and provide
only for the higher classes, shall we not eat the
fruit of our own way? The aristocracy of
France took all the wealth and power for selfish
enjoyment, and when the democracy came
into power, how awfully did they revenge
themselves! In this country, are not the rich
and influential acting on the same selfish principle?
“And <em>the people</em> do perish for lack of
knowledge!” Oh! the horrors of that day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
when this neglected people shall visit their
wrongs on those, who now are selfishly withholding
that light of knowledge which is the
only means of our peace and salvation!</p>

<p>In attempting to influence others to engage
in this work, appeals can be made to the
generous and patriotic feelings of <em>the young</em>
with great effect. Why cannot an enthusiasm
be created for educating children which
shall equal that which has been created for
preventing and curing intemperance? Let
the same amount of money be spent, and the
same number of good and influential men attempt
to do it, and <em>it will be done</em>. Let every
woman, then, urge on this attempt.</p>

<p>If a woman can do nothing else for this
cause, she can at least <em>pray</em> for it; and it is
rarely the case that any person offers sincere
and earnest prayer for any good object, without
speedily finding something <em>to do</em> for that object.</p>

<p>In attempting to enlist American women in
the work of securing <em>a proper</em> education to
the children of this nation, there is one topic
worthy of special consideration. The great
problem of the age on this subject is, how shall
the moral and religious instruction of children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
be secured <em>at school</em>? When we consider the
vast multitudes of children who have no such
training, either at home or anywhere else,
this question becomes one of paramount interest;
for, unless virtuous and moral principles
and habits are formed, education only adds
new powers of mischief to those who are trained.
The indifference of a large portion of the
community to this subject, and the extreme
sensitiveness of sectarian jealousy, interpose
great obstacles; but these may be much more
readily overcome than many suppose.</p>

<p>Professor Stowe, in his Report to the Legislature
of Ohio on the Prussian System of
Schools, makes these remarks.</p>

<p>“The universal success, also, and very beneficial
results, with which the arts of drawing
and designing, music, and also <em>moral instruction
and the Bible</em>, have been introduced into
schools, was another fact peculiarly interesting
to me.</p>

<p>“I asked all the teachers with whom I conversed
whether they did not sometimes find
children incapable of learning to draw and to
sing. I have had but one reply, and that was,
that they found the same diversity of natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
talent in regard to these as in regard to reading,
writing, and other branches of education;
but they had never seen a child capable of
learning to read and write, who could not be
taught to sing well and draw neatly; and that,
too, without taking any time which would interfere
with, or which would not rather promote
progress in other studies.</p>

<p>“In regard to the necessity of moral instruction
and the beneficial influence of the Bible in
schools, the testimony was no less explicit and
uniform. I inquired of all classes of teachers,
and of men of every grade of religious faith;
instructers in common schools, high schools,
and schools of art; of professors in colleges,
universities, and professional seminaries in cities
and in the country; in places where there was
a uniformity of creed, and in places where
there was a diversity of creeds; I inquired of
believers and unbelievers, of rationalists and
enthusiasts, of Catholics and Protestants, and
I never found but one reply: and that was,
that to leave the moral faculty uninstructed
was to leave the most important part of the
human mind undeveloped, and to strip education
of almost everything that makes it valuable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and that the Bible is the best book to put
into the hands of children, to interest, to exercise,
and to unfold both the intellectual and
moral powers. Every teacher whom I consulted
repelled with indignation the idea, that
moral instruction is not proper for schools, and
that the Bible cannot be introduced into common
schools without sectarian bias in teaching.”</p>

<p>While it is universally conceded by all intelligent
persons, that there is no nation on earth,
whose prosperity, and even existence, so much
depends on the <em>moral training</em> of the mass of
the people, there is no nation, <em>where schools are
established by law</em>, in which so little of it is done.
It is mournful to reflect, that by far the larger
part of our schools banish religious and moral
training altogether, and confine their efforts entirely
to the training of <em>the intellect</em>, and a great
part of them merely to that of <em>the memory</em>.</p>

<p>It is supposed, by many, that the Sunday-school
in our country, to a great degree, supplies
the deficiencies of our schools in respect
to moral and religious training. It is true that
this institution does more than any other to
meet these wants. But it must be remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
that such schools are properly sustained
only where there is a large number of benevolent
and intelligent persons to teach them.</p>

<p>But in our country, the places which most
need such labourers are the very places where
the fewest are to be found. And even in the
most favoured portions of our land, much
of Sunday instructions is committed to very
young persons, while the parents often are
thus led to throw off their own responsibility
upon those of less experience.</p>

<p>Moreover, if the moral training of children
is neglected through the six days of the week,
in which they are exposed to the most temptation,
how vain to expect that all the consequent
evil is to be remedied by gathering them for
an hour or two on Sunday, to receive religious
instruction. Even were this a remedy, there
are thousands of places in our land where no
Sunday-schools are to be found.</p>

<p>Many persons justify the neglect of moral
training in our schools, by claiming that religion
must be banished from schools, on account
of the great diversity of sects, who cannot agree
in this matter. Such are little aware on how
many important points all sects are agreed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
To exhibit this, and to aid any who may be induced
to attempt a course of moral and religious
training in their schools, the following
is presented as an outline of a course of instruction
that could be introduced into <em>all</em>
schools, without violating the conscientious
scruples of a single denomination in this nation,
professing to be Christian.</p>

<p>In the first place, all children in schools, can
be taught, that <em>the Bible</em> contains the rules of
duty given by God, which all men are bound
to obey. This is what all denominations allow,
and if there is any dispute about <em>which translation</em>
is the proper one, each child can be allowed
to use the Bible his parents think to be
right.</p>

<p>When this is duly taught, the children can
be required, for several successive mornings,
each to repeat a passage from the Bible, which
teaches the <em>character</em> of God.</p>

<p>When this subject is exhausted, then the
teacher can compose a form of prayer consisting
exclusively of passages from the Bible, to
be used as the first act of school duty. The
children might be required to repeat each portion,
either with, or after the teacher, simultaneously,
and thus unite in the exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is presented as a specimen of
the prayers, of which a great variety could be
made, simply by arranging texts from the Bible:</p>

<p>O God, thou art my God; early will I seek
thee.</p>

<p>My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O
Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer
unto thee, and look up.</p>

<p>For thou art not a God that hast pleasure in
wickedness; neither shall evil dwell with thee.</p>

<p>Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness; make
thy way straight before my face.</p>

<p>Remove far from me vanity and lies; give
me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with
food convenient for me;</p>

<p>Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, “Who
is the Lord?” or lest I be poor and steal, and
take the name of my God in vain.</p>

<p>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.
Fear God and keep his commandments,
for this is the whole duty of man.</p>

<p>For God shall bring every work into judgment,
with every secret thing.</p>

<p>O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face,
because we have sinned against thee; neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God,
to walk in his laws which he set before us.</p>

<p>To the Lord our God belong mercies and
forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against
him.</p>

<p>For thou art the Lord, the Lord God, merciful
and gracious, long suffering, and abundant
in mercy and truth. Therefore will we trust
in thee.</p>

<p>To the only wise God, our Saviour, be glory
and majesty, dominion and power, both now
and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><i>Or this</i>:</p>

<p>O Lord, my God, thou art very great; thou
art clothed with honour and majesty:</p>

<p>Who coverest thyself with light as with a
garment, who stretchest out the heavens like a
curtain.</p>

<p>Who layeth the beams of his chambers in
great waters, who maketh the clouds his chariot,
who walketh upon the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle
who shall dwell in thy holy hill?</p>

<p>He that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness,
and speaketh the truth in his heart.</p>

<p>He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a
reproach against his neighbour.</p>

<p>In whose eyes a vile person is contemned;
but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</p>

<p>He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth
not.</p>

<p>He that doeth these things shall never be
moved.</p>

<p>O Lord, thou hast searched me and known
me.</p>

<p>Thou knowest my down-sitting and my up-rising;
thou understandest my thoughts afar
off.</p>

<p>Thou compassest my path and my lying
down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</p>

<p>For there is not a word in my tongue, but
lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.</p>

<p>Thou hast beset me behind and before, and
laid thine hand upon me.</p>

<p>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
it is high; I cannot attain unto it.</p>

<p>I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully
made; marvellous are thy works, and
that my soul knoweth right well.</p>

<p>Search me, O God, and know my heart; try
me, and know my thoughts;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>And see if there be any wicked way in me,
and lead me in the way everlasting.</p>

<p>Now unto the King, eternal, immortal, invisible,
the only wise God, be honour and glory
now and forever. Amen.</p>

<p>Next, the children may be required to bring
texts in reply to such questions as these:</p>

<p>Who is Jesus Christ?</p>

<p>For what did he come into this world?</p>

<p>What is the character of Jesus Christ?</p>

<p>What has he done for us?</p>

<p>What does he require of us?</p>

<p>What is to be the condition of those who
are wicked after death?</p>

<p>What is to be the condition of the good
after death?</p>

<p>How are we to escape from the portion of
the wicked after death?</p>

<p>How are we to gain the rewards of the good
after death?</p>

<p>Some such question can be given each
morning; and the children can be required
to learn a text from the Bible, which will
answer this question, to repeat the next morning.
If they are too young to find it themselves,
they can be required to ask the aid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
their companions who are older, or of their
friends at home.</p>

<p>The being, character, and works of God, the
feelings and duties owed to him, and our relations
and duties in reference to a future state,
are the topics which usually are classed as
<em>religious</em> instruction.</p>

<p><em>Moral training</em> commonly is understood as
relating to the duties we owe to ourselves
and to our fellow-creatures. In this department
the following methods could be adopted:</p>

<p>Each morning, some one of such practical
texts as the following could be given out for
the children to reflect on through the day, and
in reference to which, they can be required to
seek from books, or from their friends, some
cases in which this command of God is either
obeyed or disobeyed.</p>

<p>“Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”</p>

<p>“Whatsoever ye would that men should do
to you, do ye even so to them.”</p>

<p>“Recompense to no one evil for evil.”</p>

<p>“Forbear one another, and forgive one another,
if any one have a quarrel; as Christ forgave
you, so also do ye.”</p>

<p>“Bless them that curse you; bless, and curse
not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he
thirst, give him drink.”</p>

<p>“Put away <em>lying</em>, and speak every one truth
with his neighbour.”</p>

<p>“Put on humbleness of mind, meekness, long
suffering.”</p>

<p>“Be followers of Christ, who did no sin, neither
was guile found in his mouth; who hath
left us an example, that we should walk in his
steps.”</p>

<p>When such texts are given out, their spirit
and meaning should be illustrated by example,
and then the children should be required to
learn the text, and next morning to bring some
case to illustrate the violation of, or obedience
to this rule.</p>

<p>But it is not sufficient to give children clear
views of duty, and store their memories with
the precepts enforcing their duties.</p>

<p>The teachers should keep a strict watch
over the children, and whenever any conduct
or disposition appears, that violates these rules,
they should be pointedly applied. <em>A precept
from the Bible</em> should be employed to counteract
whatever bad disposition or bad conduct
is observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>For example, if a child complains that a companion
has defaced his booklet the faulty child
be called up, and made to repeat the command
of God which he has violated: such as, “Whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you, do
ye even so to them.” If a child has taken a
pen from his companion without leave, take occasion,
on reprimanding him, to set before the
school the evil and danger of pilfering. Enlarge
on the nobleness of strict honesty and
uprightness. Show that the evil is not so much
the loss of property by the owner as the <em>bad
habit</em> induced in the pilferer, which may lead
at last to the dungeon and the gallows.</p>

<p>Again, if a child is found to be <em>prevaricating</em>,
or using <em>any kind</em> of deceit, require him to repeat
the commands of God, “Thou shalt not
bear false witness.” “Lie not at all.” “Lying
lips are an abomination to the Lord, but
they that deal truly are his delight.”</p>

<p>Then set forth lying before the school, as
what should be held in universal abhorrence;
show the importance of <em>truth</em>, as indispensable
to the existence of society and the happiness
of all beings; show how any kind of attempts
at deceit weakens the habit of truthfulness, and
certainly will lead, at last, to lying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>When it is needful to punish, endeavour to
select a penalty that will have a good effect on
the school, instead of one that will awaken
sympathy for the offender. When a child is
<em>whipped</em>, in many cases, his cries excite pity and
sympathy, and often indignation at the teacher.
But if, when a child has broken the laws of
God, the teacher sets forth the evil of the sin,
and then takes some such precept as this,
“Withdraw thyself from every brother that
walketh disorderly,” as his directory in requiring
all the school to be separate from him,
shutting him out from the play-ground, and depriving
him of the usual period of recess until
the delinquent appears penitent and anxious
to do well; then the teacher appears to the
school as acting by Divine authority, and for
the good of the whole.</p>

<p>There are many sins against such commands
of God as these: “Let all things be done decently
and in order.” “Whatsoever things are
lovely and of good report, think of these things.”
“Be ye courteous.” The violations of the rules
of politeness, of neatness, and of order, come
under these precepts, and school is the place,
above all others, where such faults should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
checked. Throwing down hats and caps, abusing
clothes, tearing books, defiling desks with
ink, cutting the benches, marking the walls, are
faults which ought to be noticed as disobedience
to these rules. So, also, rude language, calling
nicknames, teasing and frightening companions,
mocking the aged, or deformed, or
lame, cruel treatment of birds and other animals,
injuring trees, and many similar practices,
should be checked by appeals to the Word
of God.</p>

<p>In addition to this, let the <em>benefits</em> of refined
taste and good breeding be set forth by specific
examples. Show the consequences where the
children of a community are rude in the streets,
abuse and injure fences, milestones, graveyards,
and fruit-trees, and then set forth the advantages
of <em>street</em> politeness, of the care of our neighbours’
property, and of all that belongs to the
public.</p>

<p>In all efforts to lead children to benevolent
feelings and conduct, it is very important to
set before them the example of Jesus Christ,
appealing to their feelings of gratitude and
love.</p>

<p>If a child frets at being obliged to serve another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
let him be reminded that Jesus Christ
has done far more for him, and that he came
into this world to set us an example, that we
should walk in his steps.</p>

<p>While it is indispensable to notice and reprove
faults, it is no less important to notice
and approve whatever is commendable in children.
And much care should be taken to observe
whatever is right, for it is much easier
and much better to govern by motives of pleasure
rather than those of pain.</p>

<p>Whenever, therefore, any cases are observed
of kindness, firmness, patience, truth, and
faithfulness, let them be spoken of, not in such
a way as to awaken vanity, but simply with
approbation as <em>right</em>, and worthy of imitation.</p>

<p>For example, if a child gives up some gratification
in order to relieve some poor companion,
or furnish a destitute schoolmate with
clothes or books; if a child has aided or defended
a companion when laughed at, or ill-treated;
if another has found some tempting article,
and, instead of secreting it, has sought out the
owner and returned it; if, when insulted and
provoked, another has refrained from angry
words and all retaliation; if another has refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to believe evil of a companion, and endeavoured
to stop an injurious report; if another has
taken care to preserve his own premises from
filth and disorder, and protected the schoolhouse
and play-ground from abuse; let all
such actions be presented to the school as
good, and worthy of imitation. Commendation
not only encourages and animates those
who do well, but inspires the desire to imitate
in others.</p>

<p>In cases where a teacher assumes the care
of a school where there are many children who
have formed bad habits, it is very important
that he should imitate Christ in his feelings and
deportment towards sinners. In such a case,
it is very important to convince his pupils that,
however bad they are, he is still their friend,
and ever ready to do them good. He should
state to them that he is aware that they have
formed bad habits, and that the labour of curing
them is great and difficult. He should
carefully notice all <em>attempts</em> to do better, and
where there are efforts made to improve, occasional
failures should be spoken of with words
of kindness, sympathy, and encouragement.</p>

<p>And all teachers need to be careful not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
be so frequent in finding fault, and so severe
in manner as to produce the feeling of hopelessness
in efforts to please and satisfy. When
a child feels that, however earnestly he may
try to do right, he has such bad habits already
formed that he shall not succeed so as to
please his teacher, all motive for exertion
ceases, and he becomes reckless and hardened.</p>

<p>The great art of curing faults is, so to secure
the affection and confidence of a child,
that he shall be a cheerful co-worker with his
teacher, assured of approbation in success,
and of forbearance and sympathy in any failure.</p>

<p>In cases where the morals of a school are
very bad, it will be wise for a teacher to let
many things pass unnoticed that in a better
community he would reprove.</p>

<p>Some one, two, or three rules of duty can
be presented at a time, and diligent efforts be
made to remedy habits which violate these
rules. When some gain has been made on
these points, then one or two more can be
added, and thus a <em>gradual</em> advance will secure
far more success than attempting everything
at once.</p>

<p>There are many ways of rendering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Bible interesting to children, which should, if
possible, be introduced into common schools.
Some of these will be mentioned.</p>

<p>When reading the historical parts of the
Old or New Testament, a large map of Palestine
and the other countries spoken of in the
Bible, should be suspended before the school,
and all the places mentioned be pointed out.
There are large maps of this kind to be obtained
of the Sunday-school Union.</p>

<p>There is also a cheap chart of history prepared
by a Mr. Lyman, which is most excellent
for aiding in the study both of sacred and
profane history. It is so made that it can be
hung conveniently around the wall of a schoolroom,
and is so large, that children can read
the names and events while sitting in their
seats.</p>

<p>Besides these articles, there are large drawings
to be obtained of the tabernacle and all
the articles spoken of in the Pentateuch, and
others, also, that illustrate the manners and customs,
dress, furniture, and dwellings of the Israelites,
and the scenery of Palestine. These
pictures, employed to illustrate the history of
the Bible, would give wonderful interest to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
exercise of reading it. It is hoped that, ere
long, gentlemen of wealth will begin to endow
<em>common schools</em> with such useful apparatus,
instead of confining their benefactions exclusively
to higher seminaries.</p>

<p>In reading the Bible in schools, the following
method will be found to be both useful
and interesting: Let the teacher, by the aid
of Townsend’s Bible, arrange a regular course
of Bible history chronologically, selecting only
such chapters as will carry on a connected
and complete history. This can be read
aloud by the children in portions each morning;
and by the aid of the maps, pictures, and
charts, a vivid interest can be imparted to the
exercise, while, at the same time, opportunities
will be given to the teacher to notice incidents
that convey moral instruction.</p>

<p>After this course is completed, then the
teacher can prepare a course of <em>biographical</em>
reading, arranged in chronological order,
and use this opportunity also to point out the
moral instruction to be found in these histories
of individuals. Next, he might arrange a
course embracing the didactic portions of the
Bible, combining in one course of reading all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the moral precepts; and while this is going on,
he can collect anecdotes to relate to the school
illustrating these precepts. Lastly, he might
make a selection of the poetry and other rhetorical
beauties of the Bible, and, while this is
being read, point out the inimitable sublimity
and beauty of the ideas and the style. The Introduction
to the Study of the Bible by Horne,
the larger edition, and Lowth on Hebrew poetry,
are works which would greatly aid a teacher
in such a course of Biblical instruction.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In this course of moral training, it will be
seen that there is nothing sectarian, and nothing
which would be objected to by any but
those opposed to the use of the Bible in schools,
and to all religious and moral training. In
such cases, it would be proper to adopt the
following course:</p>

<p>It could be stated to the objector, that in
this country it is <em>the majority</em> that must decide
every question not already settled by the
Constitutions of the state or nation. That, in
regard to the question of moral and religious
training in the schools, the people are free to
use their own judgment. That where the majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
wish to have such training a part of
school exercises, they have a right to require
it. But in cases where persons object to having
their children so trained, the majority have
no right to insist on it. In order to avoid this, in
every case where a parent requests it, his children
can be allowed to leave the schoolroom
while these exercises are going on, to study, or
to perform some other school duty. Or if this is
inconvenient, they can be allowed to come
half an hour later, and then remain half an
hour longer, after the others are dismissed.
No man could object to such an arrangement
without violating the first principle of our democracy,
by demanding that the <em>minority</em>, and
not the <em>majority</em>, shall be accommodated in
this matter.</p>

<p>Now is it not practicable for every woman,
who attempts to promote the <em>proper</em> education
of American children, to use whatever influence
she may have with parents, or teachers
to secure such a course of moral training in
the schools in her own vicinity, as is here indicated?
Let every woman <em>try</em> what she can
do to promote this important object.</p>

<p>American woman, whose eye may be resting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
on this page, are you willing to commence
an effort to aid in saving your country from
the perils of ignorance? Are you not spending
more time in adorning your person, your children,
or your residence, or in social enjoyments,
or in providing for the gratification of
the palate, than you have yet given to this
cause? Can you continue this unchristian,
unpatriotic apportionment of time, without an
upbraiding conscience? Do you say that already
you have more to do than you can properly
perform? But, in the list of your pursuits,
are there not some that are of far inferior consequence
to this, which it would do no harm to
curtail, and thus gain time for this? Do you
not spend time and money for articles of dress,
or ornaments, or in social intercourse, or for
needless luxuries, that you might, without any
evil, give up to this object?</p>

<p>Do you say that you can do but little, and
relieve yourself from obligation because it is
so little? Suppose each drop of rain should
urge this plea, and thus delay to refresh the
fields? Is not every great and good work accomplished
by <em>a union of many little influences</em>,
and as much so in the moral as in the natural
world?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Are you dwelling in those parts of our land
where most is done for education, and comforting
yourself that at least you and yours
shall escape in safety? But how can you tell
that in five or ten years either you, or those
you love best, will not be the other side of the
Alleghany, and in the most destitute portion
of the nation? The changes of fortune, the
pursuit of wealth, the mutations of matrimonial
connexions, utterly forbid any reliance on
permanency of residence.</p>

<p>And how can one portion of this nation suffer
and the other escape? Is not the vast River
Valley, whatever may be the character of
its millions, to hold the controlling power of
our nation? If any portion of the fair West
be tortured with civil commotion and lawless
rage, will not every groan re-echo from the maternal
heart of New-England and New-York,
whose sons and daughters are dwelling on every
prairie and in every valley of our land?</p>

<p>Mother, whose hands are so busy in ornamenting
your darling child; Sister, whose fingers
fly so swiftly over the canvass or lace;
Daughter, so earnestly engaged in preparing
your elegant habiliments, look back to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
beautiful daughter of emperors, that sister of
kings, that mother of princes, brought to her
palace-home amid a nation’s transports, the
welcome bride of the nation’s heir.</p>

<p>Again, on the birth of her first-born, hear the
triumphant pæan re-echoed across the ocean,
sung by the very children in our streets, and
in the memory of many now on the stage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A Dauphin’s born! let cannon loud</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With echoes rend the sky;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">All hail to Gallia’s King!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Columbia’s great ally!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And thus the great English orator of that
day describes her: “It is now sixteen or seventeen
years since I saw the Queen of France,
then the Dauphiness, at Versailles: and surely
never lighted on this orb, which she scarcely
seemed to touch, a more delightful vision!
I saw her, just above the horizon, decorating
and cheering the elevated sphere she just began
to move in, glittering like the morning
star, full of life, and splendour, and joy. Little
did I dream I should have lived to see such
disasters fall upon her, in a nation of gallant
men, in a nation of men of honour and of cavaliers.
I thought ten thousand swords would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
have leaped from their scabbards to avenge
even a look that threatened her with insult.”</p>

<p>Look, now, through those prison bars. There,
pale and mournful, upon a pallet of straw, rests
one for whom the splendours of Versailles
scarcely seemed enough. Her once bright
locks, even in youth, are gray with fear and
sorrow. She is in solitude; her husband in
one cell, and her weeping children, torn from
her and placed with brutal keepers, in another.
And now her husband is borne forth to
a bloody death. Again her prison doors unclose,
and she comes forth, seated on the fatal
car, her hands tied behind her back, surrounded
by thousands, who shout with malignant
joy as the fatal guillotine terminates her woes.</p>

<p>See that last and most innocent sufferer, the
poor little Dauphin, every tender feeling crushed,
deliberately instructed in vice, doomed to
disgusting and degrading services, and, ere
long, cruelly starved to death!</p>

<p>American mother, wife, sister, daughter, the
same earthquake is trembling under your feet!
If such an awful period agitates any portion
of this land, it will be those raised by wealth
and station as the objects of popular envy, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
must first meet the storm. You sit now in
peace and plenty; you spend your time in
elegant pleasures, and, while absorbed in selfish
enjoyment, you forget the young and destitute
growing up around you. And as you
embroider the flower, and twine the silk, and
fold the riband, they are learning to sharpen
the dagger, and twine the cord, and plant the
cannon. Within a stone’s throw of that smiling
child with golden locks, who now absorbs
a mother’s thoughts, may be growing up, in
the darkness of ignorance and vice, the very
hand that, at some awful crisis, will grasp
those locks in rage, and plant the dagger in
that happy bosom.</p>

<p>And when, in some after hour of terror and
distress, when the roar of musketry is heard,
shooting down father and husband, and brother
and friend; when the bells are tolling, and
the drums beating, and the wife, mother, and
daughter behold those they love best girding
to meet the violators of law; when they catch
the parting expression of flushed excitement,
or stern determination, or serious foreboding,
as the loved one departs, perhaps to be returned
a breathless corse&mdash;then, in the hour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
anxious solitude, will the solemn inquest be
made for those ruffian minds, ruined by neglect;
and the voice of the Lord God will be
heard, walking in the trees of the garden, demanding,
“Where is thy brother?” And the
trembling response, “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
will meet the stern rebuke, “What hast
thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood
crieth unto me from the ground.”</p>

<p>But why appeal to motives of fear and danger?
Alas! those thousands and millions of neglected
little ones in our land, they know not their wants
or their danger, or they would raise their supplicating
hands. Is there anything more appropriate
than that gentle woman should be
invoked to their aid? Is there anything more
beautiful, more heavenly, than that she should
spend her time, and thoughts, and means to
rescue them? What is it that you would enjoy
the most in after days, gazing at the fading
beauties you have wrought in canvass, muslin,
or lace, or looking around on the intelligent,
useful, happy minds you have been instrumental
in training, and who will rise up and call
you blessed? True, you cannot gain this rich
reward without some self-denying toil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
persevering effort. But is it not worth the
labour?</p>

<p>And when your eye is closing on earth, and
the memories of the past are hovering around
your pillow, who do you wish should meet
your dying eye, the haggard faces of those
ruined by your neglect, or the grateful smiles
of those you have toiled to bless, who will bear
you in their love and prayers, like seraph’s
wings, to the opening gates of heaven; who
will shine forever as stars in your crown of
rejoicing?</p>

<p>And into that world of perfected benevolence
and joy, who is it that shall enter and
go no more out? It is those who, in this
world, have followed the footsteps of Jesus
Christ; who have lived, not for themselves, but
for others; who, like him, have <em>denied themselves
daily</em> to promote the salvation of the
lost. Is not Jesus Christ presented as the
bright and perfect example of <em>self-denying
benevolence</em>, and is it not written, “If any man
have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his?”</p>

<p>Oh, ye who are appointed by Him, who toiled
for your salvation, to go forth and rescue
these little ones, what saith your great Exemplar?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
“Ye are the light of the world; and if
the light <em>in you</em> be darkness, how great is
that darkness!”</p>

<p>Where, then, are your golden lamps?
Whom will you guide to the light and liberty
of his presence? Awake, from the dream
of thoughtless pleasure! Awake from the
reveries of selfish care, and save yourselves
and your country, ere it be forever too late!</p>

<h2 id="A_PLAN_PROPOSED">A PLAN PROPOSED.</h2>

<p>It is the object of what follows, to enable every
woman, who wishes to do something for the cause
of education and her country, <em>to act immediately</em>, before
the interest awakened is absorbed by other pursuits.</p>

<p>The thing to be aimed at is, the <em>employment of female
talent and benevolence in educating ignorant and
neglected American children</em>.</p>

<p>In order to give an idea of what <em>needs</em> to be done,
and of what <em>can</em> be done, some facts will be stated of
which the writer of this volume has personal knowledge.
There are, in all parts of this country, women
of education and benevolence, and some of them
possessing wealth, who are longing for something
to do, which is more worthy of their cultivated energies
than the ordinary pursuits of women of leisure.
There is a still greater multitude of women
of good sense and benevolence, who, if educated,
would make admirable teachers, but who now have
no resource but the needle and the manufactory. It
is melancholy to see, in all mechanical trades where
woman’s labour is available, how many thousands
are following pursuits, many of them injurious to
health and to morals, and none of them qualifying
a woman, in any respect, for future domestic duties.</p>

<p>In the schoolroom, or at domestic service, a woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
is learning to train children, and to perform domestic
duties properly, but in the workshop and
manufactory, she follows a monotonous toil, useful
neither to body nor mind, often injurious to both, and
forming habits and tastes disqualifying her for future
domestic duties.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, in all parts of our country, especially
at the West, there are multitudes of flourishing
towns and villages willing and anxious to have
good schools, and able and ready to support them,
but unwilling to do anything to sustain the miserable
apology for teachers within their reach. And still
broader regions are to be found, in every direction,
not only without good teachers, but in many cases
without any desire for schools of any kind. Our
<em>two million</em> destitute children are an appalling proof
of this destitution and apathy.</p>

<p>Now, there are hundreds and thousands of enterprising,
benevolent, and, many of them, well educated
women, who would rejoice to go forth as <em>missionary
teachers</em> to these destitute children. Such
women, by their influence, not only in their schools,
but in the village around them, could do almost as
much as a missionary, and at far less expense.
For a woman needs support only for herself, a man
requires support for himself and a family. And
there are multitudes of such women, sighing over
our destitute country and wishing to be sent forth
on such a service, and yet they know of no way to
secure the object of their wishes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>In the Catholic Church, a wisdom is shown on
this subject, which Protestants as yet have not exhibited.
In that Church, if a lady of wealth and family
is led to devote herself to benevolent enterprises,
a post is immediately found for her as Lady Abbess,
or Lady Patroness, or Lady Superior, where
she secures the power, consideration, and rank,
which even ambition might covet. There is now a
Catholic institution in one of our principal western
cities, known to the writer, which is superintended
by a lady of rank and family from Belgium, and
which is only a branch of a still larger institution in
Belgium, over which another titled lady presides.
And there are several other ladies of family and
fortune from Europe, who are spending their time
and wealth in gathering American children into
the Catholic Church. Meantime, all women of
humbler station have places provided, as <em>Nuns</em> or
<em>Sisters of Charity</em>, where they can spend their benevolent
energies in honoured activity. The clergy,
having no families to occupy their time, devote
their whole attention to the extension of their faith
<em>by schools</em> as well as by <em>planting churches</em>. To these
instrumentalities are added the <em>Jesuit</em> establishment
in this country, expressly devoted to the interests
of education, with the head Jesuit for the West stationed
in Cincinnati, to supervise and promote all
plans for education. He is a man of winning manners,
great policy, untiring industry, and, so far as
human eye can see, honestly and sincerely devoted
to the cause he has espoused. Under his watchful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
eye, no energy, or benevolence, or skill is ever lost,
but all is husbanded and skilfully directed.</p>

<p>But among Protestants there is no system or organization
instituted, thus to secure and employ the
benevolent energies of the female sex in the cause
of education. If a woman finds it in her heart to
turn missionary and go away from her country to
instruct the <em>heathen</em>, in most cases, every facility is
provided, and public sentiment urges and encourages
her efforts, and she knows to whom to apply for
support and encouragement. But let a woman become
interested <em>in her own country</em>, and earnestly
desire to labour for destitute American children,
and no such means, or facilities exist as make it suitable,
or practicable to undertake. Among Catholics,
let a woman of family and fortune talk of going to
the West to teach, and she instantly is lauded as a
saint; bishops, priests, and Jesuits are at her side
to encourage and aid, and honour in life and canonization
at death are her sure reward. But let a
Protestant woman of wealth and high standing express
a wish and intention to go to the West to
teach, and it would be regarded by most of her
friends and associates as a mark of oddity&mdash;a deficiency
of good sense. Family friends would oppose,
acquaintances would sneer, a few would faintly
approve, no individual and no body of men could
be found, whose appropriate business it is to aid,
and so many obstacles would oppose, that, in most
cases, it would really be Quixotic to encounter them.
And women in humbler circumstances find almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
as insurmountable obstacles; they know of no place
where they can go, it is the business of no one to
aid them, they know of no one to whom to apply
for assistance, and thus it is that hundreds and
hundreds of women, abundantly competent to act
as missionary teachers, are pining in secret over
wasted energies, which they are longing to spend in
the most appropriate duty of women, the training of
young minds for usefulness and for Heaven. It may
be replied, that in the Catholic Church women take
vows of celibacy, which alone can enable them thus
to act for the cause of education, and that no such efficient
action for education can be anticipated from
Protestant women, whose religious faith opposes
rather than encourages this sequestration from domestic
alliances. A few facts will serve to show
the fallacy of this impression. A lady of New-England,
who for a number of years conducted a
large female institution, furnishes this as the result
of her experience. During nine years, four hundred
teachers went out from this institution. Of these,
<em>eighty-eight</em> went to the West and South. At the
end of these nine years, of the <em>eighty-eight</em> who went
to the West and South, <em>sixty-four</em> (which is more than
three fourths) <em>continued as teachers</em>. Twelve of
these continued teachers after marriage. During
three years of this time, a society connected with
this institution was in operation to aid young women
in educating themselves to be teachers. This assistance
was in the form of a loan, which at no time
was to exceed <em>two hundred dollars</em> to any one individual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and this loan was to be returned whenever it
was practicable. The society remitted the debt in
cases where it was not. Means were also provided
for the appropriate protection and location of these
teachers. The number who in three years received
aid was <em>forty-three</em>, and the sum of $4340,00 was
loaned for this purpose. <em>Twenty-four</em> of these, in
the space of eight years from the first loans, refunded
from their own earnings all that was loaned.
Eight refunded in part. The remainder did not refund
within the eight years, but all who were not
sick or dead were expecting and aiming so to do.</p>

<p>A clergyman, who for a number of years was a
travelling agent for one of our benevolent institutions,
and who felt an interest in discovering the
results of the above effort, stated it as his conviction,
that no college in our country had, in the same
period, done more for the cause of education and
religion in our land than this institution had done
by sending forth its female teachers. Many other
similar facts could be stated, showing that there is
even a greater chance of permanent results in employing
<em>a given sum</em> for the education of female
teachers, than for the education of young men for
the ministry.</p>

<p>The lady who conducted this institution, and furnished
these facts, also stated, that at all times the
number of those desirous of qualifying themselves
for teachers, and who would gladly have obtained
loans for this end, was far beyond the means the
society could command, while the demands sent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to this institution for teachers, from the South and
West, was altogether more than could be supplied;
thus showing that there were places demanding
teachers, and teachers seeking for places, and no
adequate instrumentality in existence for meeting
these reciprocal demands. In the Eastern States,
it is the testimony of school committees, and others
employed in selecting teachers, that <em>crowds</em> of female
applicants are constantly turned aside, not
because they are not qualified, but because the
number of applicants greatly exceeds that of the
vacancies.</p>

<p>Another lady, who had conducted a large female
institution in New-England, made an attempt to aid
women of education and benevolence, who were
anxious to act as teachers, and wished for aid in
finding a proper location. The failure of health interrupted
her efforts, yet, with a very limited inquiry,
<em>more than a hundred</em> women of appropriate spirit
and qualifications were <em>immediately</em> found, anxious
to avail themselves of such aid; while the rumour
of such an effort, for two or three years, brought
letters to her from all parts of the country, asking
assistance, some of them in the most moving terms.</p>

<p>By the census, it appears that the excess of female
population in New-England over that of the
other sex is more than 14,000. From extensive inquiries
and consultation, the writer believes that
<em>one fourth</em> of these women would gladly engage as
teachers; that a large part are already qualified,
and that the others could be fitted for these duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
at an <em>average</em> expense of two hundred dollars
each.</p>

<p>Another fact will be mentioned to show <em>the waste</em>
of female talent and benevolence for want of some
<em>organized agency</em> which secures men whose <em>business</em>
it is to attend to the interests of education.</p>

<p>A lady, who had conducted a large female institution
in New-England, removed to one of the largest
western cities, and, in connexion with several other
ladies of experience and reputation, established an
institution, which they designed, eventually, should
become an institution for the preparation and location
of female teachers, with a school connected
with it, supported by the citizens, which should
serve as a <em>model school</em>. It was hoped that, when
the teachers had gained public confidence at the
West, as they had done at the East, funds would be
furnished, both at the East and West, which would
enable these ladies to say to hundreds of their countrywomen
interested in the effort, “Here is a resort
for you, where you may qualify yourselves to be
first-rate teachers, and be <em>aided in finding a location</em>
in the many flourishing but destitute towns and villages
of the West.”</p>

<p>The school was abundantly patronised, and successfully
conducted. The ladies then applied for a
fund of some $30,000, given for purposes of education,
by a gentleman of that city; and not specifically
devoted to any particular object. The trustees
of this fund voted to devote it to this enterprise, if
the citizens would raise $15,000 for a building. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
citizens manifested all appropriate interest, so far
as kind words and liberal offers were concerned.
Two gentlemen subscribed a thousand dollars each,
and several five hundred each, and nothing was
needed <em>but a person properly qualified, who should devote
himself to the enterprise</em>. The ladies conducting
the school, with failing health and many cares,
could not carry forward such an effort, and no <em>man</em>
could be found to devote himself to it. The result
was, that the Catholic bishop bought the building
occupied by this school for a Catholic female institution.
No other suitable building could be hired.
The hard times came on, and funds could not be
raised to build one; and thus, with tears of bitter
disappointment, the school was given up, and the
whole enterprise failed, and simply because it was
<em>the business</em> of no person to attend to the general
interests of education. Had these ladies turned
Catholics, bishops, priests, Jesuits, and all their
subordinates, would have been devoted to their
cause, and rich funds from foreign lands would have
been laid at their feet. As it was, in a wealthy and
most liberal Protestant city, where <em>four</em> of the largest
establishments in its bounds have been purchased
for <em>Catholic</em> institutions of education, and two
of them for females, a <em>Protestant</em> institution, conducted
by four female teachers of established reputation,
passed away for want of suitable accommodations.
Meantime, in that same city, the agents of various
benevolent societies took up liberal contributions for
the heathen, for slaves, for drunkards, for sailors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
for convicts, for colleges (both in and out of the
city), for the education of young men, for the distribution
of Bibles and tracts, and for many other
objects; because <em>men are supported, by voluntary contribution</em>,
to give their whole time to these objects.</p>

<p>There is no just foundation for the remark not
unfrequently made, that the Catholic Church contains
more <em>self-denying</em> benevolence than other communions,
while <em>sisters of charity</em> and <em>nuns</em> are pointed
out as illustrations. There are hundreds and
thousands of women in this Protestant land, who,
without the mistaken principles, possess all the
self-denying benevolence which, in Catholic communities,
leads to cloistered vows. The writer,
after extensive inquiries in almost all the free
states, believes it would be far within the bounds
of moderation to assert that, if any responsible persons
would pledge the pecuniary means and appropriate
protection, five hundred benevolent women
could be found <em>in less than one month</em>, with all appropriate
qualifications for <em>missionary teachers</em>.
Some of these are possessed of wealth, and still
more command a pleasant home, with all the comforts
of competence and the best society; yet they
would joyfully encounter the privations of missionary
life in efforts to save their country, could any
<em>appropriate</em> method be devised.</p>

<p>These allusions to the aid and encouragement offered
to benevolent women in the Catholic Church
are not designed to be invidious. Whatever class
of religionists conscientiously hold, that there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
safety from eternal ruin but in their church, not only
<em>Christian</em> benevolence, but common humanity should
impel them to all possible efforts, to gather every human
being into their communion. And it is feared
that Protestants do not always make sufficient
allowance for this consideration.</p>

<p>The wrong lamented is, not that Catholics act
consistently with their faith, but that Protestants do
not offer the same aid and encouragement to benevolent
Protestant women, who are so earnest in their
desires to devote time and talents, and, in some cases,
wealth, to the salvation of the children of our
country.</p>

<p>In view of these facts, it is now proposed to attempt
to raise means for educating destitute American
children, by the agency of women of education
and benevolence, who wish to engage in the work;
and for supporting at least one gentleman of suitable
character and influence, whose time shall be
wholly devoted to this enterprise.</p>

<p>The first thing which will be attempted will be
to select, from those who are desirous to engage in
such a service, a certain number of those who are
best qualified by education, energy, discretion, and
self-denying benevolence, and who are willing to
be stationed, under the protection of some adjacent
clergyman, in places where there are neither churches
or schools, assured of nothing more than is allowed
to home and foreign missionaries, namely,
a proper mode of conveyance and location, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
<em>a simple support</em>, secured by some responsible persons.</p>

<p>A small beginning will be made, under the supervision
of a committee of six gentlemen, one from
each of six different Protestant denominations. The
following gentlemen have consented to act as such
a committee until more permanent arrangements
can be made.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">Elliot</span>, Cincinnati.</li>
<li>Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">Lynd</span>, ditto.</li>
<li>Rev. <span class="smcap">James H. Perkins</span>, ditto.</li>
<li>Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">M’Guffey</span>, ditto.</li>
<li>Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">Stowe</span>, ditto.</li>
<li>Rev. Bishop <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, Louisville, Kentucky.</li>
</ul>

<p>As soon as means are raised sufficient to support
a gentleman who shall devote himself to this object,
the above committee will endeavour to organize a
Board of Managers, consisting of an equal number
of gentlemen from each of the principal Protestant
denominations, who are resident in different sections
of the country, and possess general confidence.
This board will then appoint an Executive Committee,
Treasurer, and Secretary, to superintend and
perform all the business connected with this enterprise,
who shall be located either in New-York or
Cincinnati.</p>

<p>In order to aid in raising funds for this object, a
method is proposed, which will enable every woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
who feels an interest in the effort, to contribute, at
least a small sum, to promote it.</p>

<p>Two works are now issued by the largest publishing
house in the country, which, it is believed, will
prove useful and interesting to every American woman.
An account of these works and the terms
of the contract will be found at the close of this
volume.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It will be seen that these terms are
very favourable, and involve no hazard of loss.
These works will be put into the market and be sold
at ordinary prices. <em>Half the profits</em> (after paying a
moderate compensation to the author for the time
and labour of preparing them, the amount to be decided
by the above gentlemen) will be devoted to
this object, and as the works are of a kind that will
always be useful, a large sale would secure both a
present and future income.</p>

<p>Any woman, then, who is desirous to aid in promoting
this enterprise, can do so by requesting
some bookseller in her vicinity to send for these
works, and then purchasing them herself and using
her influence to induce her friends to do the same.
Still more will be effected by securing notices
of these works in newspapers and other periodicals.</p>

<p>Should means be obtained sufficient, to secure the
services of a suitable gentleman, the following
measures are suggested as what might be attempted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p>In the first place, an effort could be made to secure
committees of ladies, of each denomination, in
all our principal cities, who shall agree to act simultaneously,
on some uniform plan, and, if need be,
keep up a correspondence in order to secure this result.
Such committees might exert themselves in
one, or all of the following ways:</p>

<p>They could, firstly, aim to secure the aid and co-operation
of the conductors of the periodical press,
literary, political, and religious. The gentleman
who engages in this enterprise, could write, or
cause others to write, articles calculated to arouse
the public mind in regard to popular education.
These articles could be transmitted to all the affiliated
committees in every part of our land, and by
their influence, be inserted in most of the newspapers,
or other periodicals within their reach. Thus
a steady and most powerful influence would be
brought to bear on the public mind. <em>The people</em>
would be aroused, and through the people, the <em>legislatures</em>
might be led to energetic and appropriate
action. And then, as fast as schools are formed, female
teachers will be in demand.</p>

<p>These committees, if it is deemed proper, might
also address private letters to clergymen of their
several denominations, asking aid and advice. Next
to the press, the pulpit is the most effective engine
of moral power, and, happily, the clergy of this
nation have ever been among the most ardent
and active friends of education, and the warm supporters
of almost every benevolent enterprise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
An appeal to them for aid must secure happy results.</p>

<p>Another method, which such committees could
adopt, would be, to make personal appeals, both to
ladies of large means and to those, also, of smaller
ability, for subscriptions to aid in educating and locating
female missionary teachers. Such subscriptions,
however, cannot be successfully sought until
some body is organized, consisting of gentlemen of
various denominations, who possess public confidence,
and who shall be properly authorized to receive
and appropriate subscriptions.</p>

<p>Another and most important measure could be
prosecuted by these committees. At the East,
where there is a superabundance of teachers, and
of women who could speedily be qualified to teach,
such committees could act in selecting the most suitable
women of their own denomination to receive
the aid provided; and the <em>number</em> might be regulated
by the relative amount of subscriptions in each denomination.</p>

<p>At the West, such committees could aid in providing
schools for those sent out, a suitable escort, a
proper home, and the advice, sympathy, and aid that
would be needed by a stranger in a strange land.</p>

<p>Were such committees known to be in existence
at <em>the East</em>, they speedily would be addressed by
multitudes of intelligent and benevolent women,
seeking aid in their efforts to gain opportunities to
impart knowledge and salvation to the perishing
<em>heathen</em> children in our own land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Were such committees in existence at <em>the West</em>,
and their eyes directed to the desolate regions of
ignorance around them, they would soon find their
warmest energies enlisted in gathering outcast
lambs into the fold of safety, to be trained and guided
to heaven.</p>

<p>To impart a more vivid idea of the wants which
are to be met, and of one of the first objects to be
aimed at, in the efforts proposed, some incidents in
the experience of the writer will be narrated.</p>

<p>In a small village, less than thirty miles from one
of the largest cities of the West, the writer once
stopped to dine. Several children were playing
about, when the following conversation took place:</p>

<p>“Is there any school in this place!”</p>

<p>“No, madam; it is a good while since we have
had one. Miss L. came and taught here nearly a
year; but she went home, and we have had no school
since.”</p>

<p>“How many children are there here who would
go to a school if there were one?”</p>

<p>“I should think there are as many as forty or
fifty.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose the parents would like to have
a school, and would pay the teacher well?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! If we could get a <em>good</em> teacher, she
would be well paid for her trouble; but none of us
know where to get one, and the men folks are too
busy to go and look for one.”</p>

<p>“Have you any clergyman in the place?”</p>

<p>“No, madam.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do the people here ever go to any church?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam; they sometimes go off a <em>good
piece</em> to W., where there is preaching sometimes.”</p>

<p>It was in another village of the West, and one as
destitute as this, that a young lady from New-England,
who came out under the care of a clergyman,
stationed herself to rear up a school. She agreed
to teach for a small sum, and to <em>board around</em> with
the parents of her pupils.</p>

<p>Most of these parents were from the South, where
they were unaccustomed to the notions of comfort
and thrift which the young lady possessed.</p>

<p>She not only taught the children at school, but,
in each family where she boarded, taught the housekeeper
how to make <em>good yeast</em> and <em>good bread</em>. She
also taught the young women how to cut dresses
and how to braid straw for bonnets.</p>

<p>Her instructions in the day-school and in the Sunday-school,
and her influence in the families, were
unbounded, and almost transforming. No minister,
however well qualified, could have wrought such
favourable changes in so short a time.</p>

<p>In another case, known to the writer, a young
lady went into such a destitute village. There was
no church, and no minister of any sect. She taught
the children through the week, and also instituted a
Sunday-school. In this she conducted religious
worship herself. Gradually the mothers came to
attend, then the fathers, until, at last, she found
herself in the office both of teacher and clergyman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
The last portion of her duties she resigned to a
minister, who, by her instrumentality, was settled
there.</p>

<p>The writer might mention several other similar
cases which have come to her knowledge.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of such destitute places in
our land, where a prudent, self-denying, and energetic
woman might be instrumental in leading a
whole community “out of darkness into marvellous
light,” and there are hundreds of such women wishing
to go to them.</p>

<p>The writer, when returning to the East, has often
been met by young friends with such representations
as these: “I have nothing to employ my time
which satisfies my conscience. I have education,
leisure, and means; can you find me a sphere of
usefulness which I can reach <em>with propriety</em>? I
cannot go off alone; for, even if I thought it proper,
my friends would not consent.”</p>

<p>Again, another friend says, “Why cannot you
find something for Miss G. to do? She is well educated,
rich, benevolent, and really is suffering for
want of something to do. She has thought of going
on a foreign mission, but surely there is enough for
her to do in her own country.”</p>

<p>Yes, surely, there is enough to do in our own
country. When will the wise, and the influential,
and the benevolent awake to this subject, and devise
the proper mode of meeting such wants?</p>

<p>Those who are interested in the project presented
in this work by no means assume that this is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
<em>best way</em>. They only feel that <em>something</em> ought to
be attempted; and that, if this effort does no other
good, it may put in train influences that will develop
a better way.</p>

<p>The writer of this volume also presents this enterprise,
not as the plan of an individual, but as a
project devised, by consultation, among many ladies
of influence and benevolence, who are interested
in securing its success. And if it is effected, it
is hoped that it will be by such <em>simultaneous</em> interest
and efforts, that no one will be conspicuous, either
as originator or leader in the enterprise.</p>

<p>The views presented in this work are those held
in common by a large number of intelligent ladies
in all parts of our land; and, though one has been
selected and requested to write this work, it should
be regarded, not as the opinions of an individual,
but as a wreath of benevolence, woven, indeed, by
one hand, but gathered from many noble and benevolent
minds.</p>

<p>The following extracts from letters received from
gentlemen of high standing in various parts of our
nation, will serve to corroborate the views expressed
in the preceding pages:</p>

<h3><i>From the Hon. Thomas Burrowes, late Secretary of
State in Pennsylvania.</i></h3>

<p>I have long been of opinion that the <em>great deficiency</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of our age and country, in reference to the sound
instruction of the coming generation, is the <em>want of
teachers</em>.</p>

<p>I am now fully convinced that this want <em>must be</em>
supplied <em>before</em> any other step can be safely or usefully
taken. Nay, I believe that, until this indispensable
preliminary measure is accomplished, money,
and effort, and legislation will be, <em>as they have been</em>,
money, and effort, and legislation <em>nearly</em> thrown
away. Since 1834, this state has expended more
than <em>five millions</em> for the support of her common
schools, and, at the end of ten years, I see but little
improvement.</p>

<p>In this immense expenditure, not a dollar has
been spent to secure this great prerequisite&mdash;<em>good
teachers</em>; and hence the system has not only failed
to obtain general favour, but is in danger of becoming
more and more unacceptable the longer it is
tried. It is sad to think that we have thus wasted
<em>five millions</em> of dollars, and <em>ten years</em> of time, to say
nothing of the labour expended and obloquy encountered,
and must now re-commence from the foundation;
but so it is.</p>

<p>I know of no cause which so much needs a <em>general
movement</em> as this. Let not its friends shrink
from the undertaking because they may not be able
to operate in all, or even in many of the states.
Let it be remembered that if a commencement
is made in one state, and a report of results sent
forth, it will serve to start the good work in all the
rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The necessities, the crying necessities of this
cause, are far and away before those of the Temperance
Reform, or of Colleges, or of Foreign Missions.
He who, being fit, should devote himself to
this cause, would confer a greater benefit on his fellow-man
than he could possibly do by any other
use of his time and talents.</p>

<p>The missionary to a heathen land opens <em>the Book
of Life</em> to his fellow-man; the missionary in this
cause opens <em>the mind</em> of his fellow-citizens, not only
to the Book of Life, but to a knowledge of all those
rights and duties, without which our free institutions
cannot stand to encourage and reform the
world.</p>

<p>If my gifts and domestic relations permitted, I
should devote myself to a mission in this and other
states for the purpose of impressing on Legislatures,
philanthropists, and teachers, the <em>necessity of Teachers’
Seminaries</em>.</p>

<p>A gentleman, supported to operate in this cause,
might be employed in this way. He could visit
different states one after another, and address the
citizens of each county in the county town, after
long and full notice. Besides addressing the people
publicly, he could appeal to leading individuals privately,
and engage them to act with him for this object.
Meantime, he could be obtaining educational
statistics for future use, and ere long he could make
such a report as would set the people to work in
earnest, and for their own sakes.</p>

<p>While thus proceeding, he could also obtain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
promise of one or more intelligent persons in each
county, to write on the subject every week in each
of the county newspapers. Articles thus addressed
to the reason, the patriotism, and the <em>economy</em> of the
people, would have a powerful effect, and cost nothing.</p>

<p>If funds could be provided from private benevolence
to establish proper <em>Teachers’ Institutions</em> in
two or three states, they would set the matter far
ahead in a few years. They would serve as <em>models</em>
and <em>inducements</em> to the public, and would not long
continue to need the support of private philanthropy.
They would really be <em>normal</em>, or <em>pattern</em> establishments.</p>

<p>Beyond a doubt, the plan ought to embrace institutions
for the preparation of <em>female</em> teachers. The
gentleness, self-devotion, and untiring humanity of
women eminently qualify them to be the instructers
of the more youthful pupils of both sexes, and of
their own of all ages. There is not a show of any
reason why male teachers only should be provided
for at the public charge, when female teachers are
as necessary, as useful, and as much confided in by
the public.</p>

<h3><i>From the Rev. Mr. Sturtevant, President of Illinois
College.</i></h3>

<p>“In regard to some voluntary organization to secure
popular education, if it were worked with a
truly liberal and Christian spirit, it could, and would,
do us great good in this state: first, by collecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
statistics of our wants, and calling attention (by <em>the
press</em>, and by <em>public lectures</em> all over the state) to
these wants, and to what has been accomplished in
other states and countries.</p>

<p>2. By supporting, at least in part, <em>model schools</em> in
different parts of the state, to show, <em>by example</em>,
what good schools are.</p>

<p>3. By bringing public sentiment to bear on the
Legislature, especially in reference to our <em>school
fund</em>. It is now nearly <em>two millions</em>, and is yearly
increasing. <em>Now</em>, its whole management is left to
the unregulated action of the Legislature, without a
<em>single mind</em> devoted to acquiring and disseminating
knowledge as to the proper mode of using it.
Whether, any one year, there shall be even one <em>intelligent</em>
friend of education in our Legislature, is a
matter of chance. If some plan be not devised for
leading the Legislature to wise views, the object of
this fund will be lost. It will a little diminish the
expense for each child, but add nothing towards getting
better schools.”</p>

<p>President Sturtevant’s account of the deplorable
state of their schools, and of the <em>public apathy</em> on
the subject, is mournful.</p>

<h3><i>From the Rev. Henry Beecher, of Indianapolis, Indiana.</i></h3>

<p>Much can be done in Indiana, much <em>ought</em> to be
done, and <em>speedily</em>; for,</p>

<p>1. It will be a more densely-populated state than
Ohio or Illinois, because its land is <em>uniformly good</em>.</p>

<p>2. It has been grievously neglected. Its settlers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
were originally from Kentucky, North Carolina,
and Pennsylvania. Such do better for flocks
and farms than for mental and moral improvement.</p>

<p>3. We have a good system of common school
education, which, for purposes of Church and State
ambition, some sectarians are disposed to break
down; and they are of the dominant sect in the
state. Those sects that foster education are in the
minority, and struggling up through many embarrassments.</p>

<p>4. We have a school fund of more than <em>two millions</em>,
which is in such neglect as threatens its <em>entire
loss</em>.</p>

<p>An agent should be supported to lecture through
the state, in every county town, to secure workers
to defend our school system, to protect our school
fund from depredators, to secure an annual Education
Convention, and otherwise exert influence.
The right man for such an agent I know. It is a
Dr. Cornett, of Versailles, Ripley Co., Ia. He is a
member of our Senate, and chairman of their Committee
on Education: a man prudent, cool, sagacious,
interested in the cause, and of great weight
in the community.</p>

<h3><i>The following is extracted from a letter from the Dr.
Cornett spoken of above.</i></h3>

<p>Strange it is, that while the benevolent among
our people are exerting themselves so much at
home and abroad, that the thousands and millions
<em>in our own country</em> who cannot so much as read one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
word in the Book of Life, should be overlooked,
and no organization effected in their behalf. It is
absurd to think of a Republic being long sustained
without the people generally being educated. To
talk of their maintaining <em>their rights</em> when denied
the means of knowing what their rights are, is to
talk nonsense. If our whole people could be educated
by <em>the right sort of teachers</em>, there would be
little need of temperance societies, and temperance
newspapers, and lectures, and other means now so
properly employed for <em>moral reformation</em>. Our children
would enter on the practical duties of life with
pure minds, well fortified against vice in all shapes.
In Indiana we are in deplorable want of <em>good teachers</em>
for our common schools. Why cannot some
plan be devised for educating intelligent boys and
girls for these duties, and then finding them situations?</p>

<p>In reference to the school fund, he says,</p>

<p>Many of our state legislators seem more disposed
to favour the borrowing of school money than
to promote education. If competent lecturers were
sent among the people, urging the value of education,
both in a <em>pecuniary</em> and <em>political</em> view, these
same demagogues would find it for their interest to
become clamorous for the cause. I have been at
the head of the Senate’s Committee on Education,
and have had great difficulty in sustaining the integrity
of our school fund. The term of my services
has expired, and I cannot resume them.
From what I know of our Legislature, I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
there is great need of a stir being made among the
people in reference to this matter and the cause in
general. My isolated condition, laborious profession,
and poor health forbid my following my feelings
in going forth as a voluntary lecturer; but
let some organization be effected, and numerous
and efficient lecturers would rise up to do <em>gratuitous</em>
work.</p>

<h3><i>The following is from Judge Lane, of the Supreme
Court of Ohio.</i></h3>

<p>I believe our Legislature, if left to itself, would
permit the Common Schools to sink and perish in
their hands. That body possesses at all times individuals
of great worth, but the larger part have
very little intelligence, and their motives of action
are entirely different from those which would subserve
this cause. I believe that an <em>association of
gentlemen</em> in this state is the only mode of leading
the Legislature into the necessary measures, and
that, through them, this might be accomplished <em>by
the press</em> and by <em>public lectures</em> (if the right man and
measures are employed). I believe that a change
of public opinion on this subject <em>cannot</em> be secured,
<em>indirectly</em>, through the elevation of the minds of a
few, nor by the dissemination of good principles
by the circulation of Bibles and tracts, or the settlement
of ministers, or the cultivation of young
men in colleges, or in any other speedy mode except
that of an association acting on a specific plan,
and pursuing it with perseverance, and by expedient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
means. I deem the employment of some <em>agent</em> indispensable
to give form and intensity to such an
association; and a man for this work would require
a rare combination of qualities.</p>

<h3><i>The following is from one of the leading Lawyers of
Ohio.</i></h3>

<p>The more I think of this subject of national education,
the more I feel anxious to be up and doing.
I do not think that any other field of labour now
presents itself in which so much good can be done,
and it is not the least important consideration, certainly,
that while thus engaged in doing good to
others, we shall be, in the highest sense, <em>educating
ourselves</em>. All that I can do, I feel anxious to do in
this great work; and as soon as any plan is definitely
arranged, I will go to work, and if I can get
time in no other way, will diminish my business for
the purpose.</p>

<h3><i>The following is from E. C. Delavan, Esq., who has
devoted so much of his time for several years to the
cause of Temperance.</i></h3>

<p>The importance of the question of national education
cannot be overrated. In a selfish point of
view, the old states could well afford to be taxed
a million a year to enlighten the new, but they
will not see it or feel it, I fear, until it is too late;
yet much can be done. When leading minds are
suitably impressed, <em>the mass</em> will be. Under God,
<em>the press</em> is the great instrument that must be used,
and <em>a long time</em> before the mass will move. It appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to me that the first step to be taken is to interest
men in all parts of the Union <em>to feed the political
and religious press</em>. Then, when the public mind
is aroused, talents and means will be found to take
hold practically.</p>

<h3><i>The following is from a Lawyer in Cincinnati.</i></h3>

<p>Our city and vicinity would furnish room for <em>a
dozen</em> labourers in this cause instead of one; and
one of the most effectual modes of operation would
be to enlist a dozen others in the cause. A man
devoted to this cause would be welcomed among
us as an angel of light by all classes and all sects,
and would be sure to enjoy the good wishes of all,
the positive aid of many, and the useful counsel of
not a few. The spirit of education is largely abroad
among us, and only wants an efficient <em>leader</em> to enable
it to breathe a new existence into the whole
moral, social, political, and religious being of our
community here, and, by necessary consequence,
into the whole valley of the West. We have the
best tools to work with, the best materials to work
upon, and we only want, and this we sadly want,
some person to influence us to use the one and act
upon the other, by commencing <em>an example</em>.</p>

<p>I should hail the commencement of such an enterprise
as the dawning of a new light upon the
West, and would not only give what little aid I
might, but would use all my little influence to make
it work effectually in its onward progress.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>These extracts will suffice to show the vast field
of labour open to a man of talents, supported for the
object aimed at.</p>

<h3><i>The following extract from an address of Prof. Stowe,
delivered at Portland in 1844, corroborates the views
expressed by the author on the subject of moral
training.</i></h3>

<p>But in this country, in consequence of our unbounded
religious freedom, the subdivisions of sect
are almost innumerable; it is impossible, in a system
of public instruction, to provide separately for
them all; and, unless religious instruction can be
given <em>without sectarianism</em>, it must be abandoned.</p>

<p>“In this country the rights of all sects are the
same, and any denomination that would have its
own rights respected must respect the rights of
others.</p>

<p>“The time which can be devoted to religious instruction
in schools is necessarily very limited;
and if there be an honest and sincere desire to do
right, the whole of this time certainly can be occupied,
with efficiency and profit, without encroaching
on the conscience of any sect which really has a
conscience.</p>

<p>“Facts show plainly that, notwithstanding the
diversity of sects, there is common ground on
which the sincerely pious of all sects substantially
agree. For example, the most acceptable books of
practical piety, which are oftenest read by Christians
of all denominations, have proceeded from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
about all the different sects into which Christendom
is divided, and are read by all with scarcely a recognition
of the difference of sect. Such are the
writings of Thomas à Kempis and Fenelon, who
were Roman Catholics; of Jeremy Taylor and
Bishop Hall, who were Churchmen; of Baxter,
Watts, and Doddridge, who were Presbyterians or
Congregationalists; of Bunyan and Andrew Fuller,
who were Baptists; of Fletcher and Charles Wesley,
who were Methodists. This fact alone shows
that there is common ground, and enough of it too,
to employ all the time which can properly be devoted
to religious instruction in our public institutions.</p>

<p>“All Christian sects, without exception, recognise
the Bible as the text-book of their religion. They
all acknowledge it to be a book given of God, and
replete with the most excellent sentiments, moral
and religious. None will admit that it is unfavourable
to their peculiar views, but, on the contrary,
all claim that it promotes them. To the use of the
Bible, then, as the text-book of religious instruction
in our schools, there can be no serious objection on
the part of Christians of any sect; and even unbelievers
very generally admit it to be a very good
and useful book.</p>

<p>“But shall it be the whole Bible? or only the
New Testament? or selections made from one or
both?</p>

<p>“A book of mere selection would be very apt to
awaken jealousy; and the exclusion of any part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the Scriptures would, to my mind, be painful. Let
every scholar, then, have a whole Bible. The book
can now be obtained so cheap, that the expense can
be no objection.</p>

<p>“But how can the teacher instruct in the Bible
without coming on to sectarian ground? He can
teach a great deal in regard to its geography and
antiquities, and can largely illustrate its narrations,
and its <em>moral</em>, and even <em>religious</em>, beauties. An honest,
intelligent teacher can find, in this way, abundant
employment for all his time, if he be himself a
lover and student of the Bible, without ever passing
into sectarian peculiarities, or giving any reasonable
ground of offence.</p>

<p>“But, apart from all this, the chief business of
instruction in this department may be the committing
to memory of portions of the Divine Word.
The most rigidly orthodox will not object to this,
for they believe every portion of the Bible to be the
<em>word of God which liveth and abideth forever</em>, and that
<em>all Scripture is profitable for doctrine</em>, <em>reproof</em>, <em>correction</em>,
<em>and instruction in righteousness</em>; and the liberal,
though they may not sympathize in the high orthodox
view of the divine excellence of the Word, yet
regard it as, on the whole, the best of books, and
the more of it their children have treasured up in
their minds, the better it must be for them. If the
parent chooses, he can always himself select the
portions to be committed by his child, or he may
leave it to the discretion of the teacher, or he may
give general directions, as selections from the Gospels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the Proverbs, the Psalms, &amp;c. It is not at all
essential that all the children of the same school,
or even of the same class, should recite the same
passages. Each child may be called upon, in turn,
to recite what each one has committed, and the recitation
may or may not be accompanied by remarks
from the teacher, as circumstances may
seem to justify or require.</p>

<p>“But there is another difficulty. The Roman
Catholics, it is said, do not desire that their children
should be instructed in the Scriptures; they receive
the apocryphal book as a part of Scripture, and contend
that we have not the whole Bible unless we
include the Apocrypha; and they object to our common
English translation.</p>

<p>“In reply to this, I remark, in the first place, there
are many parts of our land where there are no Roman
Catholics, and, of course, the difficulty will not
occur in those places.</p>

<p>“Secondly, if Roman Catholics choose to exclude
their children from a knowledge of the Bible, they
have a perfectly legal right to do so, and we have
no legal right to prevent it; nor should we desire
any such legal right, for the moment we desire any
such legal right, we abandon the Protestant principle
and adopt the Papal. Catholic parents are perfectly
competent to demand that their children
should be excused from the Bible recitation, and this
demand, if made, should be complied with; but they
have no right to demand that the Bible should be
withheld from the schools because they do not like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
it, nor do their objections render it necessary or excusable
for Protestants to discard the Bible from
schools.</p>

<p>“Again, if Roman Catholics desire that <em>their</em> children
take <em>their</em> Bibles into the schools, and recite
from them, by all means let them do so; and so of
Jews, let them recite from the Old Testament, if
they choose, to the exclusion of the New. We allow
to others equal rights with ourselves; but we
claim for ourselves, and shall insist upon having,
equal rights with all. I am perfectly willing to give
to the Roman Catholics all they can justly claim,
but I am not willing to encroach on any one’s rights,
or the rights of any Protestant denomination, for the
sake of accommodating the Roman Catholics. Nor
do I suppose that the Romanists have a claim to
any special accommodation, for they have never
yet manifested any particular disposition to accommodate
others. Let them have the same privileges
that our Protestant sects have&mdash;that is enough;
and they have no right to demand, our legislators
have no right to grant, any more; and we Protestants
will be perfectly satisfied when Protestants
can enjoy as great privileges in Italy as Roman
Catholics now enjoy in the United States. In judicious
practice, I am persuaded there will seldom
be any great difficulty, especially if there be excited
generally in the community anything like a
whole-hearted honesty and enlightened sincerity in
the cause of public instruction.</p>

<p>“It is all right for people to suit their own taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and convictions in respect to sect; and by fair means
and at proper times, to teach their children and those
under their influence to prefer the denominations
which they prefer; but farther than this no one has
any right to go. It is all wrong to hazard the well-being
of the soul, to jeopardize great public interests
for the sake of advancing the interests of a sect.
People must learn to practise some self-denial, on
Christian principles, in respect to their denominational
preferences, as well as in respect to other
things, before pure religion can ever gain a complete
victory over every form of human selfishness.</p>

<p>“Happily, there are places where religious instruction
that is purely denominational can be freely
given, so that there is no need whatever of introducing
it into our public schools. The family and
the Sunday school are the appropriate places for
such instruction; and there let each denomination
train its own children in its own peculiar way, with
none to molest or to find fault. It is their right, it
is their duty.</p>

<p>“As to the objection, that the use of the Bible in
schools makes it too common, and subjects it to contempt,
as well might it be objected that the sun becomes
contemptible because he shines every day
and illumines the beggar’s hovel as well as the bishop’s
palace. Where is the Bible most respected, in
Scotland and New-England, or in Italy and Austria?
The works of man, the robed monarch, may make
themselves contemptible by being too often seen;
but never the works of God. The children may,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and ought to be, taught to treat the book with all
possible reverence, and to preserve it as nice and
unsullied as the Catholic preserves his crucifix; and
in this way, I am sure, on all the principles of human
nature with which I am acquainted, that the
Bible will be no more likely to suffer from the habit
of daily familiarity than the crucifix.</p>

<p>“Let no one say that the religious instruction here
proposed for schools is jejune and unprofitable. I
do not so view the words of God. In any view, if
the child faithfully commit to memory so much as
the single Gospel of Matthew, or the first twenty-five
Psalms, or the first ten chapters of Proverbs,
or portions of the book of Genesis, those divine sentences
will be in his mind forever after, ready to be
called up to check him when any temptation assails
his heart, to cheer him when any sorrow oppresses
his soul, to be a lamp to his feet and a light to his
path; to be in all respects of more real and permanent
value to him than any creed, or catechism, or
system of theology, or rules of ethics, of merely
human origin, ever can be.</p>

<p>“Why should we prevent so great a good by claiming
what we have no right to claim? Are we not
willing to trust the Word of God to cut its own way?
Or can we claim to be Christians at all, while we
consent to have the Word of God and all Christian
teaching banished from our institutions of public
instruction? Let not <em>infidel coldness</em>, <em>jesuitical intolerance</em>,
or <em>sectarian jealousy</em>, rob our schools of their
greatest ornament and most precious treasure, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Bible of our fathers. Let not denominational feeling
so far prevail as to lead us to destroy the greatest
good while attempting to secure the less, as
has so often been done in the Christian world heretofore.
We are willing to give up much for the
sake of peace and united effort; but the Bible, the
word of God, the palladium of our freedom, the foundation
of all our most precious hopes, we never can,
we never will give up. Let all who love the Bible
unite to defend it, to hold on upon it forever.”</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES</h2>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The following is the mode of obtaining the facts stated
above:</p>

<p>In the census, 550,000 is the number of those who have <em>confessed</em>
their inability to read and write. That many have claimed
to be able to read and write, who are not, is thus established.
In Virginia, every man, on applying for marriage license, must
sign his name or make his mark. An examination was made
in <em>ninety-three</em> out of 123, the whole number of the county
courts giving license, and <em>one quarter</em>, and in many cases <em>one
third</em>, of the applicants could not write their names. Their
wives could not be any better educated. This indicates that
certainly as many as <em>one quarter</em> of the white adults in the state
cannot sign their names. One quarter of 329,959, which is the
adult population of Virginia, is 82,489. But the census, instead
of that number, gives only 58,789 who cannot read and write, a
difference of <em>forty per cent.</em> Take, then, the 550,000 who have
confessed their ignorance, and add <em>forty per cent.</em> for inaccuracy,
and the number is 770,000. To these, add the increase since
the census was taken, and those also who, by neglect, have lost
all ability to read and write, and <em>one million</em> is a very moderate
calculation for adult ignorance in this nation. Of these, at least
175,000 are voters. General Harrison’s majority, in 1840, was
146,000, or 24,000 <em>less</em> than the number of <em>voters</em> who cannot read
and write.&mdash;(<cite>See Mr. Mann’s 4th of July Oration.</cite>)</p>

<p>The census also records more children as attending school
than is the truth. Thus, in Massachusetts, the state records,
presented to the Legislature, are very accurate, and these make
the number several thousands <em>less</em> than the census. In 1840,
our population was fourteen millions. <em>One fourth</em> of these are
between four and sixteen, making 3,645,388 of an age to go to
school. But the census, although exaggerating the number,
shows only 1,845,244 as attending schools. This, deducted from
the number of those of age to go to school, leaves 1,800,144, or
<em>nearly one half</em>, who do not attend school. To these, add the increase
since the census, and <em>more than half</em> the children of this
nation are without schools!</p>

<p>The census also shows 4750 in penitentiaries, and their average
time of confinement is <em>four</em> years. An equal number were
in jails for <em>crime</em>, and their average time of imprisonment is six
months. Supposing them to live, on an average, eight years
after their release, and we have 85,500 <em>criminals</em> as voters.</p>

<p>In 1836, Mr. Van Buren’s majority was 25,000. Thus it is
shown, that the majority which elects our President is far outnumbered
by the <em>criminals</em> who are allowed to vote.</p>

<h2 id="NOTE_A">NOTE A.</h2>

<p>The writer, in the preceding part, has presented a
mode of religious training adapted to schools composed
of children whose parents are of different
sects.</p>

<p>There is one modification of this mode, which the
writer wishes to present to that class of parents
who not only believe in the Supreme Divinity of Jesus
Christ, but are in a habit of addressing their
worship to Him distinctively; believing that this is
the way in which we have access to God the Father,
who is worshipped as dwelling in Jesus Christ.
Such suppose that the Bible sanctions alike the
mode of addressing Jesus Christ distinctively, and
also the Father distinctively, and that we can pray
in either mode with acceptance.</p>

<p>It is believed that parents who hold this view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
will find great aid in the religious training of their
children by adopting this method.</p>

<p>In commencing instructions from the Bible, let
the first lesson consist of such texts as the following:</p>

<p>“Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.”</p>

<p>“And his name is called the <em>Word of God</em>.”</p>

<p>“All things were made by Him, and without Him
was not anything made that is made.”</p>

<p>“In whom we have redemption through his blood,
even the forgiveness of sins.”</p>

<p>“By Him were all things created that are in heaven
and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether
they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities,
or powers; all things were created by Him and for
Him, and He is before all things, and by Him all
things consist. Every house is builded by some
man, but He that built all things is God.”</p>

<p>Having thus fixed in the child’s mind that the
Creator of the world is Jesus Christ, and that the
terms Jesus Christ, God, Jehovah, and the Lord, are
different names for the same person, then let all the
Bible history in the Old Testament be read with the
understanding that the being spoken of through the
whole of it is Jesus Christ. If any one has doubts
on this point, let him read President Edwards’s work
on the History of Redemption, and let him also collate
all the passages in which God appeared to the
ancient patriarchs and prophets, and it will be clear
that there was a Jehovah who <em>sent</em>, and a Jehovah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
who was the <em>messenger</em>, and that this last was Jesus
Christ, and the one who always appeared to the
patriarchs.</p>

<p>The advantage of this mode of commencing religious
instructions is, that it presents to the mind of
a child a Being who can be clearly conceived of,
and a character which is drawn out in all those tender
and endearing exhibitions that a child can understand
and appreciate. It thus is rendered easy
for parents to obey the words of the Saviour, who,
when his mistaken disciples would have driven
them afar off, said, “Suffer <em>the little children</em> to come
unto me.”</p>

<p>If a child is taught, from the first, to pray to Jesus
Christ, all that perplexity, doubt, and difficulty
which many feel in regard to Jesus Christ and the
place he is to hold in their devotions will be escaped.
Then, if they feel any doubts as to whether
they understand correctly about the Father, and
whether they are required to worship him distinctively,
these doubts will easily be removed by these
words of Christ.</p>

<p>“He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. If
ye had known me, ye should have known my Father.
I am in the Father, and the Father in me.
The Father dwelleth in me. Believe me, I am in
the Father, and the Father in me. And whatsoever
ye ask in my name, <em>that will I do</em>; that the Father
may be glorified in the Son. If ye ask anything
in my name, I will do it.”</p>

<p>The writer has seen a family of four children, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
youngest four and the eldest not nine, where the
mother, who pursued this course, remarked that
these children seemed to be aided in overcoming
faults, and strengthened in doing right, by love to
the Saviour, just as true Christians are; and that if
they continued their present habits of feeling and
conduct, she should not know where to date the
time when they became pious.</p>

<p>There is also a mode of practical teaching in regard
to <em>right</em> and <em>wrong</em>, <em>sin</em> and <em>holiness</em>, which tends
much to aid a child’s right apprehension of truth.</p>

<p>Let the child be taught that Jesus Christ created
all his creatures for the purpose of making them <em>good</em>
and <em>happy</em>; that it is not possible for any one to be
perfectly good and happy, unless he has such a character
as Jesus Christ, and that the nearer we come to
possessing such a character, the better and happier
we are. Then set forth the character and example
of Christ, as a <em>perfectly benevolent and self-denying being</em>,
living not to gratify himself, but to do good to
others. Show the child that he <em>has not</em> such a character,
that he is living to please himself, and not to
do good, and that this is <em>selfishness</em> and <em>sin</em>. Set before
him the misery to which selfishness leads, and
the consequences of it, both here and hereafter.</p>

<p>Teach the child that the great business of life, to
us all, is, by the aid of God’s Spirit, <em>to change our
characters</em>, in order to become like Christ; that it is
a difficult work, and one that we can never accomplish
without this aid from God.</p>

<p>Show him that all the commands of Christ are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
designed to keep us from doing what will injure
ourselves or injure others, and that these rules are
so many and so strict, that no one ever will, in this
life, <em>perfectly</em> obey them <em>all</em>.</p>

<p>Teach him that the <em>true</em> children of Jesus Christ
are those who love him, and who <em>earnestly are striving</em>
to obey <em>all</em> his commands.</p>

<p>Set before the child the command of Christ, “Deny
thyself daily, and take up thy cross and follow
me,” and then teach and encourage him every day
to practise some <em>self-denial</em> in <em>doing good</em>.</p>

<p>Teach him that the more he practises this self-denial
for the good of others, the more he becomes
like Jesus Christ, and that the duty will become
easier and pleasanter, the more he practises it.</p>

<p>Inquire daily, especially at the close of the day,
whether the child has practised any self-denial in
doing good during the day, and express satisfaction
at any success.</p>

<p>Teach the child to pray for help to overcome selfishness,
and to give thanks for Divine aid when he
has performed any act of benevolent self-denial.</p>

<p>If any tendency to self-righteousness and self-complacency
is discovered, point out his various
deficiencies, or overt sins, and teach him daily to
observe and confess to God his faults.</p>

<p>Teach him that heaven is a world where all are
perfectly free from selfishness, and that those, who
are selfish, could not be happy there, and will never
find admittance until they become like Jesus Christ.
Teach him that this life is designed as a world of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
trial and discipline, to free us from selfishness, and
thus prepare us for heaven.</p>

<p>This mode, in connexion with others suggested
in the previous part, if faithfully pursued, would
produce results such as seldom have been seen.</p>

<p>These views are presented, not to oppose the
views and opinions of others, but simply to induce
those who hold them to act consistently with their
belief.</p>

<p>The other work is called the <cite>American Housekeeper’s
Receipt Book</cite>, and the following is the Preface
and Analysis of the Work.</p>

<h3><i>Preface (for the American Housekeeper’s Receipt Book.)</i></h3>

<p>The following objects are aimed at in this work:</p>

<p><em>First</em>, to furnish an <em>original</em> collection of receipts,
which shall embrace a great variety of simple and
well-cooked dishes, designed for every-day comfort
and enjoyment.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>, to include in the collection only such receipts
as have been tested by superior housekeepers,
and warranted to be <em>the best</em>. It is not a book
made up in <em>any</em> department by copying from other
books, but entirely from the experience of the best
practical housekeepers.</p>

<p><em>Third</em>, to express every receipt in language which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
is short, simple, and perspicuous, and yet to give all
directions so minutely as that the book can be kept
in the kitchen, and be used by any domestic who
can read, as a guide in <em>every one</em> of her employments
in the kitchen.</p>

<p><em>Fourth</em>, to furnish such directions in regard to small
dinner-parties and evening company as will enable
any young housekeeper to perform her part, on such
occasions, with ease, comfort, and success.</p>

<p><em>Fifth</em>, to present a good supply of the rich and elegant
dishes demanded at such entertainments, and
yet to set forth so large and tempting a variety of
what is safe, healthful, and good, in connexion with
such warnings and suggestions as it is hoped may
avail to promote a more healthful fashion in regard
both to entertainments and to daily table supplies.
No book of this kind will sell without an adequate
supply of the rich articles which custom requires, and
in furnishing them, the writer has aimed to follow
the example of Providence, which scatters profusely
both good and ill, and combines therewith the caution
alike of experience, revelation, and conscience,
“choose ye that which is good, that ye and your
seed may live.”</p>

<p><em>Sixth</em>, in the work on Domestic Economy, together
with this, to which it is a Supplement, the writer
has attempted to secure, in a cheap and popular form,
for American housekeepers, a work similar to an
English work which she has examined, entitled the
<cite>Encyclopædia of Domestic Economy, by Thomas Webster
and Mrs. Parkes</cite>, containing over twelve hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
octavo pages of closely-printed matter, treating on
every department of Domestic Economy; a work
which will be found much more useful to English
women, who have a plenty of money and well-trained
servants, than to American housekeepers. It is
believed that most in that work which would be of
any practical use to American housekeepers, will be
found in this work and the Domestic Economy.</p>

<p><em>Lastly</em>, the writer has aimed to avoid the defects
complained of by most housekeepers in regard to
works of this description issued in this country, or
sent from England, such as that, in some cases, the
receipts are so rich as to be both expensive and unhealthful;
in others, that they are so vaguely expressed
as to be very imperfect guides; in others,
that the processes are so elaborate and <em>fussing</em> as
to make double the work that is needful; and in
others, that the topics are so limited that some departments
are entirely omitted, and all are incomplete.</p>

<p>In accomplishing these objects, the writer has received
contributions of the pen, and verbal communications,
from some of the most judicious and practical
housekeepers, in almost every section of this
country, so that the work is fairly entitled to the
name it bears of the <em>American</em> Housekeeper’s Receipt
Book.</p>

<p>The following embraces most of the topics contained
in this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Suggestions to young housekeepers in regard to
style, furniture, and domestic arrangements.</p>

<p>Suggestions in regard to different modes to be
pursued both with foreign and American domestics.</p>

<p>On providing a proper supply of family stores,
on the economical care and use of them, and on
the furniture and arrangement of a store-closet.</p>

<p>On providing a proper supply of utensils to be used
in cooking, with drawings to illustrate.</p>

<p>On the proper construction of ovens, and directions
for heating and managing them.</p>

<p>Directions for securing good yeast and good bread.</p>

<p>Advice in regard to marketing, the purchase of
wood, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Receipts for breakfast dishes, biscuits, warm
cakes, tea cakes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Receipts for puddings, cakes, pies, preserves, pickles,
sauces, catsups, and also for cooking all the
various kinds of meats, soups, and vegetables.</p>

<p>The above receipts are arranged so that the more
healthful and simple ones are put in one portion, and
the richer ones in another.</p>

<p>Healthful and favourite articles of food for young
children.</p>

<p>Receipts for a variety of temperance drinks.</p>

<p>Directions for making tea, coffee, chocolate, and
other warm drinks.</p>

<p>Directions for cutting up meats, and for salting
down, corning, curing, and smoking.</p>

<p>Directions for making butter and cheese, as furnished
by a practical and scientific manufacturer of
the same, of Goshen, Conn., that land of rich butter
and cheese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>A guide to a selection of a regular course of family
dishes, which will embrace <em>a successive variety</em>,
and unite convenience with good taste and comfortable
living.</p>

<p>Receipts for articles for the sick, and drawings of
conveniences for their comfort and relief.</p>

<p>Receipts for articles for evening parties and dinner
parties, with drawings to show the proper manner
of setting tables, and of supplying and arranging
dishes, both on these and on ordinary occasions.</p>

<p>An outline of arrangements for a family in moderate
circumstances, embracing the systematic details
of work for each domestic, and the proper mode
of doing it, as furnished by an accomplished housekeeper.</p>

<p>Remarks on the different nature of food and drinks,
and their relation to the laws of health.</p>

<p>Suggestions to the domestics of a family, designed
to promote a proper appreciation of the dignity
and importance of their station, and a cheerful and
faithful performance of their duties.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous suggestions and receipts.</p>

</div>

<p>The following extract from the Preface to the
Domestic Economy will exhibit the origin of these
two works, and some of the objects aimed at by
the writer:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The author of this work was led to attempt it,
by discovering, in her extensive travels, the deplorable
sufferings of multitudes of young wives and
mothers, from the combined influence of <em>poor health,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
poor domestics, and a defective domestic education</em>. The
number of young women whose health is crushed,
ere the first few years of married life are past, would
seem incredible to one who has not investigated this
subject, and it would be vain to attempt to depict
the sorrow, discouragement, and distress experienced
in most families where the wife and mother is a
perpetual invalid.</p>

<p>“The writer became early convinced that this evil
results mainly from the fact, that young girls, especially
in the more wealthy classes, <em>are not trained
for their profession</em>. In early life, they go through a
course of school training which results in great debility
of constitution, while, at the same time, their
physical and domestic education is almost wholly
neglected. Thus they enter on their most arduous
and sacred duties so inexperienced and uninformed,
and with so little muscular and nervous strength,
that probably there is not <em>one chance in ten</em>, that young
women of the present day, will pass through the
first years of married life without such prostration
of health and spirits as makes life a burden to themselves,
and, it is to be feared, such as seriously interrupts
the confidence and happiness of married
life.</p>

<p>“The measure which, more than any other, would
tend to remedy this evil, would be to place <em>domestic
economy</em> on an equality with the other sciences in female
schools. This should be done because it <em>can</em>
be properly and systematically taught (not <em>practically</em>,
but as a <em>science</em>), as much so as <em>political economy</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
or <em>moral science</em>, or any other branch of study; because
it embraces knowledge, which will be needed,
by young women at all times and in all places; because
this science can never be <em>properly</em> taught until
it is made a branch of <em>study</em>; and because this method
will secure a dignity and importance in the estimation
of young girls, which can never be accorded
while they perceive their teachers and parents practically
attaching more value to every other department
of science than this. When young ladies are
taught the construction of their own bodies, and all
the causes in domestic life which tend to weaken
the constitution; when they are taught rightly to
appreciate and learn the most convenient and economical
modes of performing all family duties, and
of employing time and money; and when they perceive
the true estimate accorded to these things by
teachers and friends, the grand cause of this evil
will be removed. Women will be trained to secure,
as of first importance, a strong and healthy constitution,
and all those rules of thrift and economy
that will make domestic duty easy and pleasant.</p>

<p>“To promote this object, the writer prepared this
volume as a <em>text-book</em> for female schools. It has
been examined by the Massachusetts Board of Education,
and been deemed worthy by them to be admitted
as a part of the Massachusetts School Library.</p>

<p>“It has also been adopted as a text-book in some
of our largest and most popular female schools, both
at the East and West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“The following, from the pen of Mr. George B.
Emmerson, one of the most popular and successful
teachers in our country, who has introduced this
work as a text-book in his own school, will exhibit
the opinion of one who has formed his judgment
from experience in the use of the work:</p>

<p>“‘It may be objected that such things cannot be
taught by books. Why not? Why may not the
structure of the human body, and the laws of health
deduced therefrom, be as well taught as the laws of
natural philosophy? Why are not the application of
these laws to the management of infants and young
children as important to a woman as the application
of the rules of arithmetic to the extraction of the
cube root? Why may not the properties of the atmosphere
be explained, in reference to the proper
ventilation of rooms, or exercise in the open air, as
properly as to the burning of steel or sodium?
Why is not the human skeleton as curious and interesting
as the air-pump; and the action of the
brain, as the action of a steam-engine? Why may
not the healthiness of different kinds of food and
drink, the proper modes of cooking, and the rules
in reference to the modes and times of taking them,
be discussed as properly as rules of grammar, or
facts in history? Are not the principles that should
regulate clothing, the rules of cleanliness, the advantages
of early rising and domestic exercise, as
readily communicated as the principles of mineralogy,
or rules of syntax? Are not the rules of Jesus
Christ, applied to refine <em>domestic manners</em> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
preserve a <em>good temper</em>, as important as the abstract
principles of ethics, as taught by Paley, Wayland,
or Jouffroy? May not the advantages of neatness,
system, and order, be as well illustrated in showing
how they contribute to the happiness of a family,
as by showing how they add beauty to a copy-book,
or a portfolio of drawings? Would not a teacher
be as well employed in teaching the rules of economy,
in regard to time and expenses, or in regard
to dispensing charity, as in teaching double, or single
entry in book-keeping? Are not the principles
that should guide in constructing a house, and in
warming or ventilating it properly, as important to
young girls as the principles of the Athenian Commonwealth,
or the rules of Roman tactics? Is it
not as important that children should be taught the
dangers to the mental faculties, when over-excited
on the one hand, or left unoccupied on the other, as
to teach them the conflicting theories of political
economy, or the speculations of metaphysicians?
For ourselves, we have always found children, especially
girls, peculiarly ready to listen to what they
saw would prepare them for future duties. The
truth, that education should be <em>a preparation for actual,
real life</em>, has the greatest force with children.
The constantly-recurring inquiry, “What will be
the use of this study?” is always satisfied by showing,
that it will prepare for any duty, relation, or office
which, in the natural course of things, will be
likely to come.</p>

<p>“‘We think this book extremely well suited to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
used as a text-book in schools for young ladies, and
many chapters are well adapted for a reading book
for children of both sexes.’”</p>

</div>

<p>To this the writer would add the testimony of a
lady who has used this work with several classes of
young girls and young ladies. She remarked that
she had never known a school-book that awakened
more interest, and that some young girls would learn
a lesson in this when they would study nothing else.
She remarked, also, that when reciting the chapter
on the construction of houses, they became greatly
interested in inventing plans of their own, which
gave an opportunity to the teacher to point out difficulties
and defects. Had this part of domestic
economy been taught in schools, our land would not
be so defaced with awkward, misshapen, inconvenient,
and, at the same time, needlessly expensive
houses, as it now is.</p>

<p>The copyright interest in these two works is
held by a board of gentlemen appointed for the purpose,
who, after paying a moderate compensation
to the author for the time and labour spent in preparing
these works, will employ all the remainder
paid over by the publishers, to aid in educating and
locating such female teachers as wish to be employed
in those portions of our country, which are most
destitute of schools.</p>

<p>The contract with the publisher provides that the
publisher shall guaranty the sales, and thus secure
against losses from bad debts, for which he shall receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
five <i>per cent.</i> He also shall charge twenty
<i>per cent.</i> for commissions paid to retailers, and also
the expenses for printing, paper, and binding, and
make no other charges. The net profits thus determined
shall be divided equally, the publisher taking
one half, and paying the other half to the Board
above mentioned.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
